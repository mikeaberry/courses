  <p>To study Classics in the original languages of Latin and Greek is to engage with a literature which shaped the intellectual life of western Europe over many centuries and which continues to influence western culture profoundly today. The MA (Hons) in Classics will develop your Latin and Greek language skills. It will also develop skills of literary and cultural analysis which are powerful tools for understanding complex texts, arguments and problems in our own culture too.</p>
<p>The course will require you to engage in depth with a wide range of texts from classical antiquity. It involves study of the many different genres of ancient Greek and Latin literature from epic poetry and tragedy to historiography and philosophy. You will be required to develop skills of reading and understanding these texts in the original language. In the process you will also gain a broad understanding of ancient social, cultural and political history. During your time studying Classics at St&nbsp;Andrews there are opportunities also to study complementary subjects such as Ancient History and Archaeology.</p>

              <p>The MA (Hons) in Classics is a four-year course run by the School of Classics. You can take this degree whether or not you have studied Latin or Greek before. There are beginners’ courses in both Greek and Latin for those who have not studied the languages before or who have only studied them a little. These courses quickly build a solid foundation in each language so that you will rapidly become confident in analysing literature.</p>
<p>If you have already studied one or both languages at a higher level, you will undertake more advanced study in your first year in both language and literature, in modules that integrate analysis of literary texts with linguistic and translation exercises.</p>
<p>If you have not studied either language before, you may defer the start of your studies in one of the languages to your second year, and will then take special modules in Honours.</p>
<p>In second year all students are brought together to take modules that extend and refine their knowledge of Latin and Greek literature and its background, covering both prose and poetry from the archaic period right through to late antiquity, while continuing to incorporate progressive work on Greek and Latin language skills in preparation for Honours-level study.</p>
<p>In addition to studying Greek and Latin, you have the opportunity in your first two years to take another subject each semester. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>The skills you gain in analysing original Greek and Latin texts in your first two years will prepare you for exploring an even wider range of texts at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to delve deeper into a specialist topic of your choice in writing a dissertation during your fourth year.</p>
<p>All of the School’s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes. Examples of recent topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greek poetry, including epic and tragedy</li>
<li>Greek historiography, including authors like Herodotus and Thucydides</li>
<li>Greek rhetoric</li>
<li>Greek philosophy</li>
<li>Greek literature in the Roman Empire</li>
<li>Greek prose composition</li>
<li>Latin prose writing, including philosophical writing, oratory, letter writing and biography</li>
<li>Latin poetry, including didactic poetry, lyric, satire and epic</li>
<li>Late antique Latin literature</li>
<li>Latin prose composition</li>
<li>Renaissance reception of Latin literature.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide choice of other modules available to complement Classics and suit your interests. Popular choices include Classical Studies, Ancient History, English Literature, Modern Languages, Medieval and Modern History, Philosophy and Divinity.</p>
<p>Graduates in Classics from St&nbsp;Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge of Greek and Latin literature and culture and a high level of competence in Greek and Latin language.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, language classes and set-text reading classes (10 to 40 students).</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>At Honours level, teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and reading classes, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading Greek and Latin texts</li>
<li>practising language and translation skills</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Classics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/staff/">Classics staff</a> on the School of Classics website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Classics, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a></p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Almost all of the modules in Classics are assessed by a combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>research essays</li>
<li>literary criticism and commentary exercises</li>
<li>class tests, including unseen translation and grammar exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of Classics provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Classics may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6439/">History Society</a>&nbsp;hosts talks with guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209948925/?fref=ts">The Greek and Cypriot Society</a> welcomes everyone with an interest in Greece, Greek history and Greek culture.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7240/">Bacchae Society</a>&nbsp;is the student society for everyone interested in all things classical.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and main quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes. It is a lovely additional study space for students in the School.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
