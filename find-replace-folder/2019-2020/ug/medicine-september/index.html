<h4>School of Medicine requirements</h4>
<p>Students must also meet the following entry requirements of the School of Medicine in order to move on to the BSc (Hons) Medicine at the University of St Andrews:</p>
<p><strong>UCAT</strong><br>Students must achieve a competitive score in the UCAT. You must take the UCAT in the summer before you begin the Foundation programme.</p>
<p>If you are starting in September 2019, you must take the UCAT between July and October 2019. We strongly recommend you take it before you arrive in St Andrews in September. The required minimum score for the UCAT will be advised by the School of Medicine in April 2019. A score from a test taken before July 2019, cannot be used to meet this requirement. Students who successfully complete their Foundation programme in 2020, but who have not achieved the required UCAT score, will be allowed to resit the test in early July 2020.The required minimum score for tests taken in July 2020 will be advised by the School of Medicine in April 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple mini interviews (MMIs)</strong><br>Students must have successful multiple mini interviews. MMIs take place during the second semester of the Foundation programme.</p>
<p><strong>IELTS</strong><br>IELTS (Academic) with an overall score of 7.0 and at least 7.0 in each component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provided that&nbsp;you successfully complete the programme and you meet the above entry requirements for the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews, you will be given an unconditional offer to enter&nbsp;first&nbsp;year of the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/medicine/medicine-bsc-a100/">BSc Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Students who do not move on to Medicine but meet the academic requirements for the Faculty of Science, may be able to study a science degree (Biology, Chemistry or Psychology) at St&nbsp;Andrews, or to secure a place at another institution.&nbsp;Programme coordinators assist with advice and UCAS applications as necessary to work towards the best possible outcome for you.</p>
