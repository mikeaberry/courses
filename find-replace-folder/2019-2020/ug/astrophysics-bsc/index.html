  <p>The BSc in Astrophysics allows you to embark on a guided exploration of the science of the Universe, from our solar system to black holes and from extrasolar planets to galaxy clusters. Core physics, mathematics, and computational skills are developed to allow you to model these systems and to analyse complicated data sets. Students will be able to use of some of the telescopes at the University Observatory, which contains the largest operational optical telescope in the UK.</p>
<p>The degree is approximately half core physics and maths, and approximately half astrophysics. It gives you competencies that are useful in a wide range of careers in physics-based industry, in further study and research in astrophysics, in analysing “big data”, and more generally in areas such as finance and management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The BSc in Astrophysics is a four-year course (three years for those taking direct entry to second year) run by the School of Physics and Astronomy. During your degree, you will explore the science of the Universe, from extrasolar planets to cosmology. This course is largely a physics course with a specialism in astrophysics, and the astrophysics component of the course makes good use of the mathematics and physics developed in other modules in the course.</p>
<p>In the first two years of your studies you will also study modules from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, as mathematics is the language of physics. Depending on how many mathematics modules you choose to do, you may be able to choose modules in other subjects such as chemistry, computer science, philosophy, or many other subjects from across the University. The flexible nature of the degree programmes at St&nbsp;Andrews means that by appropriate choice of modules in first and second year, you may be able to change your final degree topic during your course. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>In the final two years of the course, you normally take modules in physics and astrophysics. In the final year of the course, it is possible to take modules directly applicable to astrophysics.</p>
<p>Final year students also carry out a major project, which takes one quarter of their time for the year. This is often carried out in close cooperation with one of the School’s <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/research/index.php">research groups</a>, and may be observational, computational, or theoretical in nature.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school and college leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. This allows them to complete their degree programme in three years instead of four. Find out more about <a href="direct/index.html">direct entry to second year for Astrophysics BSc</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible for students to take Astrophysics as a five-year Integrated Masters course, allowing you to graduate with a Master&nbsp;in Physics. Find out more about the <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/astrophysics-mphys/index.html">Integrated Masters degree</a>. Direct entry into second year for an Integrated Masters is also possible, allowing you to complete an Integrated Masters degree programme in four years instead of five.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>Astrophysics and Physics modules are taught through a combination of lectures, tutorials and laboratory work.</p>
<p>In both first and second year, each module typically consists of four to five lectures per week (20 to 150 students), along with one problem-solving workshop, one small group tutorial (4 to 8 students), and 2.5 hours in the teaching laboratory.</p>
<p>At Honours level, lecture-based modules typically have three lectures a week (5 to 80 students). Some modules also have small-group tutorials (5 to 9 students). Computational Astrophysics and Observational Astrophysics are examples of modules that are more directly practical, with each of these running two afternoons a week.</p>
<p>In your final semester, you will spend about 20 hours per week focusing solely on your final project.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing for laboratory work</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team. Some of these people have specialist expertise and knowledge in astrophysics, others have expertise and knowledge in other areas of physics. You will be able to have significant interaction with the staff of the School. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/contact/people/index.php?limit=1#999">contact information for all Astrophysics staff</a> on the School of Physics and Astronomy website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Physics and Astronomy, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, most modules are assessed by a mix of coursework and written examinations. In Honours years, assessment depends on the nature of the specific module. Most modules give a higher weighting to written examinations, but some are assessed solely through coursework.</p>
<p>Coursework may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>astronomical observations</li>
<li>computational work</li>
<li>laboratory work</li>
<li>tutorial problem sets</li>
<li>literature research</li>
<li>presentations</li>
<li>written work</li>
<li>classroom tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within a time specified for the assignment, in some cases two days, in some cases two weeks. Feedback is given with a view to improving your performance in the future.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students come from across Scotland, across the UK, and around the world to join an international community of students and staff, and all join the University from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>The relatively small size of the town means that students get to meet easily with many other students. Some of the optional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/traditions/">student traditions</a>&nbsp;help with this mixing. Most entrant students live in University-managed accommodation. There are over 150 student societies and sports clubs to choose from. This can all help to ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students of Physics may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6089/">Astronomy Society</a>&nbsp;(Astrosoc) runs a range of events from stargazing to an annual ball.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7307/">Physics Society</a>&nbsp;(PhySoc) promotes the understanding and enjoyment of physics. PhySoc hosts a number of events including lectures, an annual ball, day trips and pub nights.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6600/">Mathematical Society</a>&nbsp;(SUMS) organises talks on mathematics as well as lunchtime gatherings and pub nights.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7199/">St&nbsp;Andrews Engineering Group</a>&nbsp;is a group of students with a passion for engineering who complete yearly projects.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Physics and Astronomy is situated in a modern building located on the western edge of the town. Most teaching is conducted in this building, which includes a library (with two group study rooms) as well as computing and research facilities specifically for the use of Astrophysics and Physics students.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
