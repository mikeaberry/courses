  <p>St&nbsp;Andrews offers three MA (Honours) degrees with an integrated archaeological component, as well as a BA International Honours pathway. Archaeology at St&nbsp;Andrews is predominantly concerned with the culture and society of historical periods, especially the Classical world and mediaeval Europe, rather than with archaeological science. Archaeology degrees are hosted by the Schools of Classics and History. It is also possible to take a degree that incorporates joint Honours with Social Anthropology.</p>
<h3>What can I study with Archaeology?</h3>
<p>You can take Archaeology as part of the following single and joint Honours degrees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient History &amp; Archaeology (MA single Honours)</li>
<li>Ancient History &amp; Archaeology and Social Anthropology (MA joint Honours)</li>
<li>Mediaeval History &amp; Archaeology (MA single Honours)</li>
<li>Classical Studies - Ancient History &amp; Archaeology pathway (BA International Honours)</li>
</ul>

              <p>The degrees that incorporate Archaeology are run by several Schools and Departments in the University, though training in archaeological principles and analysis is primarily given by archaeologists working in the School of Classics. The courses focus on the broad applications of archaeology to history and culture, and the physical remains of past societies, rather than formal or professional training in archaeological science.</p>
<p>During your first two years of study, you will typically take the modules offered by the <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/ancient-history-ma/index.html">Ancient History MA</a> or <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/mediaeval-history-ma/index.html">Mediaeval History MA</a>&nbsp;single Honours degrees. Aspects of archaeology and material culture are integrated into these sub-honours&nbsp;modules; some modules include specific archaeological segments and topics and offer the choice to conduct assessed work on archaeological themes. The emphasis during this time is in learning to use archaeological and historical sources together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first year of your studies, you will be required to study three subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>At Honours level, you undertake advanced training in archaeological principles and analysis and choose from a wide range of modules that are largely or entirely archaeological in content.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>
<h4>Fieldwork</h4>
<p>Staff within the University occasionally conduct <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/archaeology/summerschoolsinternshipsandfunding/">active fieldwork programmes</a>. When these programmes are running, students are encouraged to apply for placement. If they are not running, every effort is made to help students find a place on an archaeological project.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Greeks in a Wider World</strong>: surveys Greek history from the origins of the Greek city-states in the Archaic period (ca. 800 BCE), through the heyday of Athens’ empire and democracy in the fifth century, to Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire. Alongside political and military history, the module tackles topics such as religion, sexuality, and Greek interactions with other peoples of the ancient Mediterranean world. Archaeological evidence is integrated throughout the module, and the archaeology of Athens is closely studied.</li>
<li><strong>Rome and the Mediterranean</strong>: traces Rome’s trajectory from a small settlement in Central Italy to the centre of a Mediterranean empire. The module examines a wide range of topics, including politics, the family, religion, slavery, poverty and the economy. It exposes the links between the growth of Rome’s power abroad and the consequence of empire at home. These consequences included a transformation in the archaeology of the city of Rome itself, as it grew from a small riverside town to a sprawling imperial capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students taking <strong>Ancient History &amp; Archaeology and Social Anthropology</strong> will also take the first-year modules in <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/social-anthropology-ma/index.html">Social Anthropology</a>.</p>
<p>Students taking <strong>Mediaeval History &amp; Archaeology</strong> take:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Fall of Rome and the Origins of Europe (400-1000)</strong>: examines how political, cultural and social life changed in the Byzantine, British and ‘barbarian’ worlds in response to major upheavals.</li>
<li><strong>Scotland and the English Empire 1070-1500</strong>: compares and relates the societies of the English crown and the kingdom of Scotland in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>Students taking <strong>Ancient History &amp; Archaeology</strong> typically take the following second-year Ancient History modules, but may take second year Classical Studies modules instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Mediterranean Communities</strong>: </strong>examines the human settlement and material culture of the entire Mediterranean world throughout classical antiquity.</li>
<li><strong>The Roman Empire</strong>: explores the Roman empire with particular reference both to social, religious and economic changes as well as to political and military history.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students taking <strong>Ancient History &amp; Archaeology and Social Anthropology</strong> will also take the second-year modules in <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/social-anthropology-ma/index.html">Social Anthropology</a>.</p>
<p>Students taking <strong>Mediaeval History &amp; Archaeology</strong> take the following compulsory second-year module:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mediaeval Europe (1000&nbsp;– 1400)</strong>: examines key themes that helped to shape Western Europe from the 11th to 14th centuries, a period known as the ‘High Middle Ages’.</li>
</ul>
<p>and choose at least one from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>History as a Discipline</strong>: </strong>Development and Key Concepts: provides an introduction to key theoretical and methodological approaches which have characterised the emergence of History as a discipline since mediaeval times.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to Middle Eastern History</strong>: provides an introduction to Middle Eastern history from the dramatic reconfiguration of the Middle East in late Antiquity to its contested and contentious recent past.</li>
<li><strong>Mediterranean Communities</strong>: deals with the human settlement and material culture of the entire Mediterranean World throughout classical antiquity.</li>
<li><strong>Scotland, Britain and Empire (c. 1500-2000)</strong>: provides an introduction to how and why the British nation state evolved from the separate kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland and how and why it has survived over the last three centuries.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>If you take any of these degrees in your third and fourth years, you will take the following compulsory third-year module:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principles and Techniques in Archaeology</strong>: provides an induction to the practical conduct of archaeology and how it affects the results of excavations and surveys, and an in-depth introduction to key archaeological topics and theories.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will then choose from a variety of advanced options which incorporate archaeology into the study of ancient and mediaeval civilisations and cultures, focusing on topics such as castles, cities and urbanisation, networks, ancient art and sculpture, and the Bronze Age civilisations of the Aegean.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Archaeological Methods</li>
<li>The Archaeology of Minoan Crete</li>
<li>Art of the Roman Empire</li>
<li>The City of Rome</li>
<li>From Pompeii to Aquileia: the Archaeology of Roman Italy (50 BCE&nbsp;– 300 CE)</li>

<p>In fourth year, students have the option of undertaking a dissertation of about 10,000 words on an approved topic in Archaeology. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p class="p1">The sub-honours modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St&nbsp;Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules currently available can be found in <span class="s1">the</span> <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/"><span class="s1">module catalogue</span></a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>The teaching format of your sub-honours courses will vary depending on your chosen degree programme. Both Ancient History and Mediaeval History modules are typically taught through lectures (maximum 200 students) supplemented by small group tutorials.</p>
<p>At Honours level, class sizes reduce from large lectures down to seminars of 10 to 20 students, with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and other timetabled sessions you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>reading ancient source materials</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team across departments with expertise and knowledge of Archaeology. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Classics staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/staff/">School of Classics website</a> and for History staff on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/staff/staffindex.html">School of History website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules at sub-honours level in both Ancient History and Mediaeval History are assessed by a combination of coursework and end-of-semester examinations. In Honours years, assessment methods vary and some modules are assessed solely or mainly through coursework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The Schools of Classics and History provide feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aim to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Archaeology may be interested in joining the following societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6068/">Student Archaeological Society</a>&nbsp;promotes the world of archaeology through an array of activities including biweekly archaeological talks, field trips, pub nights and movie nights.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/archaeology/universityarchaeologysociety/">University of St&nbsp;Andrews Archaeology Society</a> is a forum for staff, students and townspeople with a general interest in Archaeology to meet for evening lectures.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7240/">The&nbsp;Bacchae Society</a>&nbsp;is the student society for everyone with an interest in all things classical.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and main quadrangle. Students will typically attend tutorials, seminars and meetings with tutors in this building, while larger lectures are held nearby in St Salvator’s.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes. It is a lovely additional study space for students in the School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
