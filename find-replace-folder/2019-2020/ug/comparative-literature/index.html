  <p>Comparative Literature at St&nbsp;Andrews gives you the chance to explore a range of literatures – Arabic, Persian, French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish in English translation, as well as texts from the UK and US – allowing you to gain insight into the different cultural traditions, socio-political and historical forces that have helped to form national and transnational canons. A focus on close reading and an introduction to issues surrounding literary translation as well as comparative methodologies will develop your analytical, descriptive, and evaluative skills. You will have the opportunity to read, discuss, and present reasoned arguments, and work on writing with precision and clarity.</p>
<p>Whilst St&nbsp;Andrews does not offer Comparative Literature as a single Honours degree, you can take it in combination with a wide variety of other subjects as part of a joint Honours degree.</p>
<p>If you are taking Comparative Literature with a modern language, you will have the opportunity to take an <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/integrated-year-abroad/">integrated year abroad</a> between second and third year in a country in which the language you study is spoken.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The Comparative Literature element of the four-year joint Honours degree course is run by the School of Modern Languages.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will gain awareness of different genres and themes as they appear in a range of literatures (typically including Arabic, French, German, Italian, Persian, Russian, Spanish, Latin American, British and North American) and address the issue of how to study literature comparatively, especially when reading in translation. This will equip you with the range of literary experience and critical skills necessary for more in-depth study of specialist subject areas at Honours level.</p>
<p>Specialist subject areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptation</li>
<li>cultural memory</li>
<li>cultural studies</li>
<li>cultural translation</li>
<li>influence and reception</li>
<li>intermediality</li>
<li>literary translation</li>
<li>world literature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside Comparative Literature, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two.

<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Drama in the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries</strong>: introduces the study of Comparative Literature through plays written in the 20th and 21st century from France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Russia, Spain, the UK and the US.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Good and Evil</strong>: examines a broad range of texts from a number of national literatures, periods and genres in which the theme of good and evil is explored in different literary, social, political and historical contexts. Work on comparative theories and methodologies and on the importance of translation prepares students for Honours modules.</li>
<li><strong>Journeys</strong>:&nbsp;explores a broad range of texts from different national literatures, periods and genres offering variants on the theme of journeys, explored in a range of literary, social, political and historical contexts.

</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>If you decide to take Comparative Literature in your third and fourth years, you choose from a wide variety of advanced options, each based on at least three national literatures.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>

<li>Autobiography and the Visual Arts</li>
<li>Crossing the Mediterranean</li>

</ul>
<p class="normal1">In fourth year, students may also choose to undertake a 5,000 or 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice, with individual supervision.

<p class="normal1">Comparative Literature modules involve traditional lectures supported by small discussion seminars. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small group seminars allow you to work together with each other and with your tutors to discuss texts, theories and methodologies in detail.</p>
<p class="normal1">Sub-honours Comparative Literature modules are delivered through lectures (100 to 150 students) and small-group tutorials (10 to 15 students). At Honours level, lectures are replaced by tutorials of 5 to 15 students.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures and tutorials, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by leading researchers in the field with an emphasis on research-led teaching. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p class="normal1">You can find contact information for all Comparative Literature staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/comparativeliterature/">School of Modern Languages website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Modern Languages, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p class="normal1">Comparative Literature sub-honours modules are assessed by 50% coursework and 50% written examination. Assessment at Honours level varies, with most modules being assessed entirely by coursework.</p>
<p class="normal1">Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Comparative Literature may be interested in joining the following student society:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6460/">Inklight</a> is a creative writing society which runs poetry slams, open mic nights, workshops and an annual journal of student writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Modern Languages is situated at the very centre of St&nbsp;Andrews in the Buchanan Building on Union Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
