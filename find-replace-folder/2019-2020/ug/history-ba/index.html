              <p>The BA (International Hons) in History is a four-year course run jointly by the School of History at St Andrews and the Department of History at the <a href="http://www.wm.edu/as/undergraduate/more-pathways/standrews/academic_program/majors/history/index.php">College of William &amp; Mary</a>. This degree&nbsp;combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>You will study for two years at both St Andrews and William &amp; Mary, spending the first year of the programme at one institution and the second year at the other. You will then be able to choose where you wish to spend your third and fourth years of study and graduate from either university.</p>
<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>If you study the BA (International Honours) in History, you will discover and analyse the full range of human activity over time. Through historical awareness, which enriches contemporary experience by linking the present with the past, you will be able to recognise the cultural and social values that have shaped cultures across the globe. From your studies, you will acquire intellectual skills in evaluating different kinds of evidence, and interpreting and communicating its significance to others.</p>
<p>At St Andrews, your studies will focus on medieval and early modern Europe, including the history of Scotland, England, the British Empire, and Middle Eastern studies.</p>
<p>At William &amp; Mary, your studies will focus on the history of early America, and 19th and 20th<sup>&nbsp;</sup>century America and Europe, as well as early modern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.</p>
<p>In addition, the joint degree in History requires extensive coursework in a foreign language (Arabic, German, Italian, French, Latin, Russian, or Spanish). Students will typically take one language class during all eight of their semesters.</p>
<p>Your studies will culminate in a significant research project that demonstrates high-caliber scholarship.</p>
<p>The BA (International Honours)&nbsp;is a broadly based degree, and other combinations – such as joint Honours degrees – are not available with this programme. However, during the programme you will have opportunities to study a range of other subjects offered by both institutions.

<p>At St Andrews, teaching in first and second year is delivered primarily through lectures (usually 100 to 300 students) and small group tutorials (6 to 8 students). Lectures are given by all members of the School, enabling students to hear active researchers in each field talk about their specialism. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third and fourth year at St Andrews, teaching moves away from large group lecturing. Students meet in groups of about 10 to 15 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.</p>
<p>Though a good deal of the study of&nbsp;History involves individual effort, group work provides a sense of confirmation, fruitful disagreement, and community to complement the sometimes solitary business of reading and writing.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students at St Andrews are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>At St Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of History. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/staff/staffindex.html">History staff</a> on the School of History website.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to your studies in the School, optional </span><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the </span></strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules in History at St Andrews are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>research essays</li>
<li>class presentations</li>
<li>source analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Classroom examinations often incorporate essays and source exercises. In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of History aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of History may be interested in joining the following student societies at St Andrews:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6068/">Archaeological Society</a> is for those interested in anything from ancient weaponry to Indiana Jones. The society organises bi-weekly meetings (featuring guest speakers), social events, movie nights, and day trips to archaeological sites.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6439/">History Society</a> hosts talks with guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of History occupies three sites all within a few minutes’ walk of each other at the heart of the historic town of St&nbsp;Andrews. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in these buildings, while larger lectures are located in nearby buildings. The School of History sites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>St Katharine’s Lodge, a 19th-century former school near the seafront</li>
<li>New Arts Building, a modern building with lecture classrooms and study spaces</li>
<li>St John’s House, located on South Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
