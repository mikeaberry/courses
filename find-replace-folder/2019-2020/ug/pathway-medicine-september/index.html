  <p>The International Pathway to Medicine (September intake) is a two-year programme of study with two phases. During the first year (Phase 1), you will focus on science-related topics and in the second year (Phase 2) you will focus on the study of Medicine.</p>
<p>This programme offers students the potential to move on to a degree in Medicine at the University of St Andrews.</p>
<p>The Pathway programme aims to develop scientific knowledge to prepare students for their study of Medicine, as well as equip students with the communicative skills and knowledge of ethics appropriate for the&nbsp;subject.</p>

              <p>The September Pathway to Medicine programme is a two-year, two-phase programme designed to help students function effectively as undergraduates at the University.</p>
<p>The course aims to ensure that students develop the analytical approach to learning and communication skills which are required to study Medicine in a British university. The structure of the programme provides students with dedicated support in the first year when it is most needed, but progressively enables students to work more independently and collaboratively as they will do on their degree programmes.</p>
<p>You will learn to adapt to studying in a university environment and to develop a deeper knowledge of key sciences as well as general communication skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will join science modules with first-year students from the beginning of the programme. In the second year, the programme will also introduce you to&nbsp;courses in medical ethics and clinical communication skills, as well as medical-related sciences.</p>
<p>Classes integrate science and English language learning through a focus on writing laboratory reports, structuring essays, critical thinking and scientific methods of investigation.</p>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Classes take place from Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm.&nbsp;You will spend approximately 18 to 21 hours per week in taught classes. During this time, you will experience a mixture of lectures, seminars, tutorials, classes and practicals (including in laboratories). The academic modules and lectures may have more than 100 students in them; the other modules will likely have class sizes between 14 and 16 students.</p>
<p>As well as your timetabled classes, you will be expected to complete at least a further 20 hours of study each week. As a fully matriculated student, you have access to the University’s libraries and study areas, but you will also work within the University's online learning environment (known as Moodle).</p>
<p>In Phase 2 of the Pathway to Medicine, which is known as the International Foundation programme for Medicine, students are introduced to simulated and real patients throughout the programme and are given opportunities to explore how to communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds with a variety of health conditions.</p>
<p>Students are also encouraged to volunteer with a local charity during the programme. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.castlefurniture.org/befriending">Castle Befriending project</a>&nbsp;provides support and companionship for the elderly and vulnerable in the local area. Students who have participated in this project have enjoyed meeting local people and making a difference&nbsp;to&nbsp;their lives.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;University’s student services team can help students who have additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities.&nbsp;More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>

              <p>The fee package for the&nbsp;Pathway to Medicine programme includes catered accommodation. The University arranges this on your behalf so you do not need to apply for accommodation.</p>
<p>All Pathway students are allocated a room in <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/accommodation/halls/dra/">David Russell Apartments (DRA)</a>, just a 10-minute walk from the Centre for International Foundation Programmes. In each apartment, there are five study bedrooms, each with its own private shower and toilet, and a shared living space and fully equipped kitchen.</p>
<h3>Bedding pack</h3>
<p>A bedding pack will be delivered to David Russell Apartments for each Pathway student. The bedding pack is for a standard double bed (UK size) and contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>one duvet (10.5 tog)</li>
<li>one duvet cover</li>
<li>one flat sheet</li>
<li>two pillows</li>
<li>two pillowcases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meals</h3>
<p>Pathway programme students are on a catered meal plan that gives them 14 meals per week during the semester.</p>
<p>Breakfast and an evening meal are served every weekday; breakfast and lunch are served on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>See a <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/accommodation/halls/catered-en-suite/#d.en.21534">sample menu for the 14-meal plan</a>.</p>

                <h3>Progression from Phase 1 to Phase 2</h3>
<p>In order to progress from Phase 1 of the Pathway to Medicine to Phase 2, the International Foundation programme for Medicine, students must achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>an overall GPA of 12.0</li>
<li>a GPA of 11.0 for Biology 1 (BL1101) and Organic and Biological Chemistry 1 (CH1601)</li>
<li>A GPA of 11.0 for Fundamental Chemistry and Physiology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are graded on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/academicdatateam/assessmentandawards/gradingsheets/">University's 20-point scale</a>.</p>
<p>Students must take the UCAT in the summer between the two phases. This is required by the School of Medicine who will advise the required score by the end of Phase 1.</p>
<p>Students also have an informal meeting with the director of the International Foundation programme for Medicine and will carry a letter of reference from the director of the Pathway to Medicine. Students are&nbsp;expected to undertake a period of clinical observation&nbsp;before starting Phase 2.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Moving from Phase 2 to the BSc in Medicine</h3>
<p class="p2">In order to progress onto the <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/medicine-bsc-a100/index.html">BSc in Medicine</a>&nbsp;at St Andrews, students must achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>an overall grade of 14.0 or above for the International Foundation programme for Medicine (ET1030)</li>
<li>a grade of 12.0 or above for each Faculty of Science module:
<ul>
<li>Introductory Inorganic and Physical Chemistry (CH1401)</li>
<li>Psychology 1 (PS1001)</li>
<li>Psychology 2 (PS1002)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an overall grade of 14.0 or above for Human Biology</li>
<li>an overall grade of 14.0 or above for Foundations for Medicine 1 and 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students must also meet the following entry requirements of the School of Medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>a competitive score in the UCAT taken in the summer before Phase 2 (the International Foundation programme for Medicine)</li>
<li>successful multiple mini interviews</li>
<li>IELTS (Academic) with an overall score of 7.0 and at least 7.0 in each component.</li>
</ul>
<p>Provided that you meet the above entry requirements for the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews, you will be given an unconditional offer to enter first year of the BSc Medicine.</p>
<p>Students who do not successfully complete all the requirements to move on to the degree in Medicine but meet the academic requirements for the Faculty of Science may be able to study a science degree (Biology, Chemistry or Psychology) at St Andrews, or to secure a place at another institution. Programme coordinators assist with advice and UCAS applications as necessary to work towards the best possible outcome for you.</p>
