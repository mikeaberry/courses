  <p>The MA (Hons) in Philosophy will familiarise you with the views put forward by the principal figures of the philosophical tradition. It will also provide you with the means of rationally and independently assessing arguments. Studying Philosophy is about acquiring skills of criticism and analysis, of clear thinking and principled debate.</p>
<p>During your studies, you will explore some of the oldest and most complex questions asked by human beings from Greek antiquity to the present day. For example: what differentiates truth from falsehood, and reality from appearance? Are we really free in our decisions and actions, or is freedom an illusion? Are moral values objective, and if so in what sense? What justifies some in exercising power over others?&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The MA (Hons) in Philosophy is a four-year course run by the Department of Philosophy. During your degree, you will be trained in precise and effective reading, as well as clear thinking and writing required for philosophical study.</p>
<p>In the first two years, as a sub-honours student, you will study some of the great books in philosophy and be introduced to the fundamental questions discussed by philosophers from ancient Greece to the present day, exploring both theoretical and practical questions. This will lay the foundations required for an Honours degree.</p>
<p>Alongside Philosophy, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study at least one additional subject, sometimes two. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>During your final two years, as an Honours student, you will focus your studies on your particular philosophical interests and will be able to choose from a wide variety of advanced options, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>aesthetics</li>
<li>epistemology (the study of knowledge)</li>
<li>ethical and political theory</li>
<li>formal logic</li>
<li>metaphysics</li>
<li>philosophies of logic, mind and language</li>
<li>philosophies of film, creativity, law, economics and religion</li>
<li>feminist philosophy</li>
<li>texts in the history of philosophy.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Final-year students may also choose to write a dissertation on a philosophical topic chosen in consultation with teaching staff.&nbsp;Students can work on the dissertation for either one semester or the whole year.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Graduates in Philosophy from St&nbsp;Andrews can expect to have acquired a highly developed sense of independent critical thinking and judgement and to be able to communicate ideas and arguments clearly and effectively.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>Philosophy sub-honours modules are primarily delivered through formal lectures (40 to 220 students) complimented by small group tutorials (7 to 9 students). Tutorials allow students to discuss their ideas, questions and problems with a tutor and with fellow students.</p>
<p>At Honours level, students attend smaller lectures (10 to 50 students) along with seminars (10 students), where you may often be asked to present and discuss your own work.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures and tutorials you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Philosophy. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/dept/staffprofiles/">Philosophy staff</a> on the Department of Philosophy website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the Department of Philosophy, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Almost all the sub-honours modules in Philosophy are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and written examinations. At Honours level, some modules are assessed entirely by coursework, while others include written examinations.</p>
<p>Coursework includes essays, research projects, logic exercises and in-class presentations.</p>
<p>Written examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback within three weeks.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Philosophy may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6705/">Philosophy Society</a> which hosts talks from distinguished guest speakers covering a wide range of areas in philosophy. The society also organises a number of social events including pub quizzes, holiday parties and movie evenings, and it publishes its own undergraduate philosophy journal, <em>Aporia</em>.</p>
<p>The Department of Philosophy is located in Edgecliffe, a Scottish Baronial house situated on a small cliff with views across St&nbsp;Andrews Bay. Edgecliffe is home to a departmental library with over 5,000 volumes. Most Philosophy seminars and tutorials will take place here, with larger lectures taking place in nearby buildings.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
