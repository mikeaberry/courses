  <p>The MMath (Hons) in Applied Mathematics will teach you to understand complex patterns and structures, and develop the tools with which to analyse them. Whether these patterns relate to physical or biological phenomena or the structure of mathematics itself, the primary aim is to describe, categorise, and understand the processes involved.</p>
<p>Students of Applied Mathematics will specifically focus on real-world applications of mathematics, applying their tools to solve problems in fields as diverse as biology, astrophysics, and finance.</p>
<p>The MMath allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree.</p>
<p>Students can also take Mathematics as a standard <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/mathematics-bsc/index.html">four-year BSc degree</a>.</p>

<p>In first year, teaching for each module centres on a daily lecture (100 to 250 students) and a weekly small group tutorial (8 to 12 students) where students undertake exercises and discuss each week’s topics. In addition, computer labs (25 to 60 students) are held once a week for each module to assist with both computing and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>In second year, each module typically comprises five lectures (100 to 250 students), one tutorial (8 to 12 students), one computer lab (25 to 60 students), and one examples class (25 to 60 students) per fortnight.</p>
<p>You will develop increasing independence and initiative as you progress through your degree programme so that by third, fourth and fifth year the average teaching load drops to around ten hours of lectures and four tutorials per week, supplemented by private study.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and computer labs you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>

<p>The demand for mathematically able graduates exceeds the supply and the career prospects for graduates in Mathematics from St&nbsp;Andrews are excellent. Clear logical thinking, deductive reasoning, confidence in data handling, and IT skills are attributes that are highly prized by employers.</p>
<p>Around one-third of Mathematics graduates go on to pursue postgraduate qualifications either in the UK or abroad, and develop research careers. Others gain employment in a variety of sectors including:</p>
<ul>
<li>accountancy</li>
<li>actuarial profession</li>
<li>civil service</li>
<li>computing</li>
<li>intelligence (private sector)</li>
<li>investment banking and investment management</li>
<li>management consultancy</li>
<li>political risk analysis</li>
<li>technical and investigative science.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Each summer the School of Mathematics takes on interns for a few weeks (typically six to eight weeks), in pure, applied and statistics research areas. Interns&nbsp;are each assigned to a supervisor in the School and work with them to&nbsp;gain an understanding of&nbsp;what it’s like to do research, in order to see whether a PhD is a suitable&nbsp;next step.&nbsp;Internships are&nbsp;competitive and cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/careers/">Careers Centre</a> offers one-to-one advice to all students as well as a programme of events to assist students to build their employability skills.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Mathematics may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6600/">Mathematics Society (SUMS)</a>, a society dedicated to bringing people together who are interested in maths. They hold regular socials and informative talks from guest speakers.</p>
<p>The School of Mathematics and Statistics is currently split between two sites – the Mathematical Institute on the North Haugh and the Scott Lang Building at the Observatory. Most of the Mathematics staff and research students can be found at the Mathematical Institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
