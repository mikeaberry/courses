              <p>The BSc in Biomolecular Science is a four-year course run jointly by the School of Chemistry and the School of Biology. Chemistry at St&nbsp;Andrews provides students with a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of chemistry, along with intellectual training in numeracy, problem-solving, teamwork and communications.</p>
<p>Alongside chemistry and biology, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study at least one additional subject. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>The skills you gain in research and analysis during these years will prepare you to undertake more advanced and specialist modules during your final two years (known as Honours). These specialist subjects include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>protein structure and function</li>
<li>structure-based drug discovery</li>
<li>carbohydrate and nucleic acid chemistry</li>
<li>chemical biology.</li>
</ul>
<p>During your final year, you will also carry out a research project on a topic chosen in consultation with staff from the Schools.</p>

<li>Second year: lectures 80 to 120, practicals 40 to 60</li>
<li>Third year: lectures 20 to 60, practicals 20 to 60</li>
<li>Fourth year: seminars 5 to 20.</li>
</ul>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and practical classes, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of biology and chemistry. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Biology staff on the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/">School of Biology website</a> and Chemistry staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/chemistry/">School of Chemistry website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the Schools of Biology and Chemistry, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>All sub-honours modules are assessed by 60% to 70% written examinations combined with 30% to 40% coursework covering laboratories, tutorials and transferable skills exercises.</p>
<p>For Honours modules, assessment is either by written examination for lecture-based modules, or by coursework including written reports, oral presentations and oral examinations for laboratory, workshop and research project modules.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The Schools of Biology and Chemistry provide feedback on every assessment with a view to improving your performance in future, and aim to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>Given the small, elite nature of the University, the School of Chemistry at the University of St Andrews offers a unique experience blending education in state-of-the-art science facilities while enjoying the traditions of an ancient university in a historic and picturesque setting.</p>
<p>The relatively small size of&nbsp;the School's undergraduate chemistry cohort results in a rather unique nurturing and nourishing environment where students have frequent contact with world-class academics. The School of Chemistry is ranked as one of the top Chemistry departments in the UK, and is known for the personal and flexible nature of its undergraduate Chemistry programmes.</p>
<p>The School of Chemistry is located in the Biomedical Sciences Building and the Purdie Building in the North Haugh on the western edge of town. These buildings offer recently upgraded lecture theatres and seminar rooms, as well as state-of-the-art teaching laboratories for chemistry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biology lectures and practicals take place in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> One other area available for Biology students is the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute building, a spectacular zoology museum which includes the arrangement of species to show evolutionary relationships between animals.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
