              <p>The MA (Hons) in Theological Studies is a four-year course run by the School of Divinity. The course combines three distinct but closely related fields of study: theology, church history and practical theology.</p>
<p>Modules in theology consider key topics (God, salvation, Jesus Christ, Trinity, creation) in relation to the contexts in which they emerged and developed throughout Christian history, and some of the key thinkers who developed those concepts. They also consider some of the distinctive challenges to faith in the modern world.</p>
<p>Modules in practical theology explore ways in which Christianity is being expressed and lived out today. They include the study of:</p>
<ul>
<li>worship, spirituality and the political involvement of the churches in contemporary Britain</li>
<li>liturgy and social reflection in Latin America</li>
<li>dance, worship and healing in Africa</li>
<li>moral decision-making</li>
<li>bioethics (abortion, euthanasia, genetic engineering)</li>
<li>political ethics (economic justice and political power, ecological issues)</li>
<li>personal relationships (marriage, sexuality, friendship).</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside Theological Studies, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>The skills you gain in detailed analytical study will prepare you for your final two years, during which you will take advanced courses on primary texts of Christian theology. You will also be able to choose from a range of specialist subject modules in areas including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>particular theologioans in their context</li>
<li>particular doctrines</li>
<li>theological ethics</li>
<li>church history</li>
<li>inter-religious dialogue</li>
<li>Christian mysticism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final year students must also complete a 10,000 word dissertation on a Theological Studies topic chosen in consultation with teaching staff.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Teaching in the first and second years is mainly by lectures (10 to 100 students), supplemented by regular small-group tutorials (10 to 15 students).</p>
<p>At Honours level, greater emphasis is put on individual study and on students taking a major role in preparing for, and conducting, seminars (5 to 15 students).</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and workshops, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>undertaking assigned and recommended readings</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Theological Studies. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Divinity staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/">School of Divinity website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Divinity, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>All sub-honours modules are assessed by 50% coursework and 50% written examinations. At Honours level, at least 50% assessed work is coursework, with some modules including no exam element at all.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of Divinity provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Theological Studies may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/admissions/ug/stm/stmsoc/">St Mary’s College Society</a>. The society organises social events for the staff and students of the School of Divinity. The society is very active with Friday lunches, pub evenings, the annual dinner, the annual ball and the Christmas lunch. They also have a charitable and spiritual role within the college, raising money for different charities throughout the year.</p>
<p>The School of Divinity is located in St Mary’s College, one of the oldest and most historic parts of the University, where theology has been taught for over 500 years. Today, teaching takes place in seminar rooms and lecture theatres equipped with the latest technology both within St Mary’s and around the University. The Divinity library is housed in the historic King James Library, and students have their own common room in the former Principal’s House.</p>
<p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews</a>.</p>
