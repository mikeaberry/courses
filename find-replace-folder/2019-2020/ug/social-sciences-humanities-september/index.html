              <p>The aim of the International Foundation programme for Social Sciences and Humanities is to prepare you for the demands of an undergraduate degree programme. The combination and integration of academic study skills and academic lecture courses is designed to give you a broad base of academic subject knowledge from various disciplines as well as the intellectual skills to critically analyse concepts to a high level.</p>
<p>Students study a range of issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>politics</li>
<li>economics</li>
<li>law</li>
<li>media.</li>
</ul>
<p>These subjects provide an extremely useful basis for all academic disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humanities and allow you to understand some of the underlying political, philosophical and economic ideas which underpin many of the subjects you can study at St Andrews.</p>
<p>Using academic texts based on these issues, students develop the skills to read and interpret texts and develop the language and techniques to structure arguments so that they become more skilled at writing assignments and speaking and presenting in seminars.</p>
<p>Working on projects to develop research skills, along with the course's integrated approach to language and academic subjects, will allow you to develop a more analytical approach to your studies.</p>
<p>In particular, this programme provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>the potential for progression onto a single or joint Honours degree programme</li>
<li>a thorough grounding in classical and sociological issues pertaining to a range of disciplines in the arts and humanities</li>
<li>small group teaching with highly experienced teachers</li>
<li>intensive and academic teaching designed to help you develop the skills to succeed</li>
<li>a strong emphasis on criticality, improving analytical skills, time management and writing in authentic academic contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the programme you will have a strong foundation on which to base your undergraduate degree studies. You will have a clear understanding of the key political, philosophical and economic ideas that underpin many of the subjects that you will be going on to study. You will also have knowledge of the university system and experience of different types of assessment.&nbsp;</p>

These include reading for essay writing, listening to take part in seminars and discussions, academic vocabulary and expression, and language accuracy.</p>
<p>There are three modules in the first semester:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Sciences and Humanities: Academic Skills</strong> - introduces&nbsp;students to the preferred style and structure of work produced for assessment on an undergraduate degree.</li>
<li><strong>Language and Criticality in Social Sciences and Humanities</strong> -&nbsp;gives each individual student the opportunity to identify and work on their own linguistic strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>Social Sciences and Humanities: Academic Core</strong> - weekly one-hour lectures and tutorials in subjects such as 'Introduction to Social Sciences and Humanities', 'History', and 'Psychology'.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the study of literature and sociology, you will learn how to approach studying an academic subject at undergraduate level. You&nbsp;will then be expected to apply these skills and strategies to your lectures and tutorials in the core subjects of sociology, history and psychology. These sessions will introduce you to many of the key theories and concepts in the arts, humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>For more details of each module, including weekly contact hours, teaching methods and assessment, please see the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>&nbsp;which is for the 2018–2019 academic year; some elements may be subject to change for 2019 entry.</p></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>In Semester 2, you will be encouraged to become a more independent learner, and you will read and research for the purpose of completing a range of written assessments. There is also a project where you will be assessed through presentations on topics chosen in consultation with your tutors.</p>
<p>There are three modules in the second semester:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Sciences&nbsp;and Humanities: Integrated Skills</strong> -&nbsp;builds on the key skills and strategies covered in the Academic Skills module in Semester 1.</li>
<li><strong>Communicating in Social Sciences&nbsp;and Humanities</strong> -&nbsp;students develop the ability to select and evaluate sources for essays and presentations.</li>
<li><strong>Social Sciences&nbsp;and Humanities: Academic Electives</strong> -&nbsp;students will study the core subjects (Social Sciences, History, Psychology) and will also be able to choose their own options from a list which typically includes: International Relations, Philosophy, Film Studies, Art History, Literature, and Psychology.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have pathway options from which to choose your own academic subjects in this semester, and&nbsp;staff will provide advice on the most suitable options related to your future degree intention. Common combinations of subjects in this semester are:</p>
<ul>
<li>International Relations, Philosophy and History</li>
<li>Art History, Literature and Film Studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other subjects and combinations may be offered depending on the needs of individual students each year.</p>
