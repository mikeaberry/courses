You will gain a deep understanding of the biology of marine organisms from tiny cells to large marine mammals. You will&nbsp;study at an advanced, research-led level and your topics will cover a broad range from marine molecular ecology, genomics, marine microbiology, the ecology and development of marine life from invertebrates to marine mammals, as well as the ecology of coasts and estuaries.</p>
<p>St&nbsp;Andrews’ location on the shores of the North Sea makes it the ideal place to study marine wildlife in its natural habitat. Teaching takes advantage of this and you will have the opportunity to learn not only in the lab but also out in the field. The School of Biology has the world-renowned Scottish Oceans Institute, which incorporates the world-class Sea Mammal Research Unit which you can access in order to facilitate your study.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The BSc in Marine Biology is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern marine biologist.</p>
<p>In the first two years of your degree, you will take the core modules in Biology along with modules intended to prepare you for advanced modules in Marine Biology specifically. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside Biology, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules that allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, enquiry-based learning.</p>
<p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
<p>These facilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>&nbsp;houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems.

<ul>
<li><strong>Biology 1</strong>: provides an introduction to molecular and cellular biology. It covers cell diversity and the origins of life, cellular structures and fundamental processes.</li>
<li><strong>Biology 2</strong>: provides an introduction to the diversity of life on Earth and will address key elements of organismal and ecological aspects of life.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>In second year, modules are chosen which will best prepare you for Marine Biology, and new topics are introduced in some second-year modules such as evolutionary biology and ecology.

<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Ecology:</strong> </strong>introduces basic concepts in population and community ecology and how they relate to biodiversity.</li>
<li><strong>Research methods in Biology</strong>: develops essential academic and transferable skills, with major emphasis on problem solving. This is achieved through a combination of interactive lectures, independent data-handling workshops and group work on a mini research project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students must also take <strong>two</strong> of the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Comparative Physiology</strong>: </strong>covers the principles of physiological adaptation in a range of animals, including examples from all major taxa and from all habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Biology</strong>: gives an overview of the history and major principles of modern evolutionary biology.</li>
<li><strong>Invertebrate Zoology</strong>: surveys the major invertebrate groups, emphasising the diversity of body plans while demonstrating how the common functional requirements such as feeding, reproduction, respiration and excretion are achieved.</li>
<li><strong>Vertebrate Zoology: </strong>explores the diversity of vertebrate animals, beginning with the closest relatives of vertebrates and the evolutionary origins of the group.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>In third year, you will continue to specialise in Marine Biology via a wide range of modules covering core topics. Modules that have been offered in previous years include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aquatic Ecology</li>
<li>Developmental Biology</li>

<p>Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
<p>Fourth year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typical class sizes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: lectures 240 to 270 students, practicals 80 to 90 students</li>
<li>Second year: lectures 80 to 120 students, practicals 40 to 60 students</li>
<li>Third year: lectures 20 to 60 students, practicals 20 to 60 students</li>
<li>Fourth year: 5 to 20 students.</li>
</ul>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by leading researchers in the field with an emphasis on research-led teaching. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Biology staff on the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/">School of Biology website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Biology, optional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a></p>
<h4>Field trips</h4>
<p>From first year to Honours, students studying Marine Biology will also have the opportunity to go on field trips to gather data. Students in Marine Biology will be perfectly located in St&nbsp;Andrews on the shores of the east coast. In Honours years, students can explore further afield in places such as Indonesia and Antarctica.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
<p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Biology provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</span></p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Marine Biology students have lectures and practicals in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute building, houses a spectacular Zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.</p>
<p>There’s also the opportunity to join the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
