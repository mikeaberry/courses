  <p>The MSci (Hons) in Computer Science will teach you the principles of computer science and computer systems. You will learn how to program computers and how systems are organised, designed and implemented. During your studies, you will both explore the theoretical basis of computer science and will develop practical skills in software engineering.</p>
<p>You will be able to build a degree programme around your interests and study specialist areas, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, computer security, video games, data encoding, databases, and operating systems.</p>
<p>The MSci allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree.&nbsp;Students can choose to take Computer Science as a standard <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/computer-science-bsc/index.html">four-year BSc degree</a> instead.</p>

              <p>The MSci (Hons) in Computer Science is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Computer Science. The course is designed to ground you in both the theory and practice of computer science. You will learn to think and solve problems logically, understand the fundamental principles of how computing systems work, and be exposed to significant new technologies as well as teamwork.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will learn the basic concepts behind computer science and several different programming languages. You will carry this training into your third year where you will learn the theory and practical principles of computer science, and learn how computing techniques can be used to analyse problems.</p>
<p>Alongside Computer Science, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study at least one additional subject. In the second year, you can continue with this other subject or focus entirely on Computer Science. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>During your final two years, you will be able to take both undergraduate and Masters-level modules, enabling breadth and depth across the discipline. You will also be able to explore the intellectual frontiers of computer science by studying more advanced and cutting-edge topics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>artificial intelligence</li>
<li>computer security</li>
<li>databases</li>
<li>data encoding</li>
<li>human-computer interaction</li>
<li>operating systems</li>
<li>video games.</li>
</ul>
<p>In your final year, you will undertake an advanced project within the School. These projects can involve collaboration with an industrial partner or be undertaken in the context of an ongoing research project.</p>

<li>First year: lectures 72 to 170, labs up to 100, tutorials 6 to 7</li>
<li>Second year: lectures 70 to 104, labs up to 100, tutorials 6 to 7</li>
<li>Honours: lectures, labs and tutorials 9 to 69.</li>
</ul>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and computer labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>using library resources</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Computer Science. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials and demonstrations in laboratory classes, as well as assessment of coursework, under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/directory">contact information for all Computer Science staff</a> on the School of Computer Science website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Computer Science, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a></p>

                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Most Computer Science modules are assessed by at least 40% with the rest of assessment in the form of written examinations. Project modules are assessed entirely by coursework.</p>
<p>The School uses a range of forms of assessment for the coursework component. For example, these could include programming assignments and projects, design exercises, and problem sheets.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of Computer Science aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Computer Science may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6236/">Computing Society</a> (STACS) provides a social group for people interested in computers or who are looking to undertake projects involving computing. Events include hackathons, talks on computer topics, and socials.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6383/">Gaming Society</a> meets regularly to play and discuss a variety of video games, ranging from retro and handhelds to modern PC and console gaming.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7199/">Saints Engineering Group</a> promotes the development of engineering skills for STEM fields and completes yearly engineering projects, some of which involve developing software and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Computer Science is situated in the Jack Cole and John Honey Buildings on the western edge of town, and most lectures and tutorials will take place here. The buildings host both traditional lecture theatres as well as specialised rooms equipped with computer workstations. As a student, you will have all-hours access to teaching labs which provide a vibrant environment that supports individual and group work.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews.</a></p>
