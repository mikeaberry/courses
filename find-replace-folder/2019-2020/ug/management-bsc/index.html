  <h1 class="page-heading">Management BSc (Hons) <span style="color: #6A6A6B">2019 entry</span></h1>
  <p>The BSc (Hons) in Management introduces you to organisations in all sectors and teaches you to understand techniques which draw from the subject including marketing, organisational behaviour, managing in diverse and challenging situations, and analysing financial data. From your studies, you acquire interpersonal skills in problem solving, critical thinking and self-reliance, and are empowered to interrogate evidence, challenge logic, and question existing ways of doing things.</p>
<p>You learn from a team of international scholars whose teaching and research are based on the concept of responsible enterprise, which entails an ethical approach to managing organisations and their social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The BSc course is particularly suited for those wanting a range of options across Science subjects, but who want to give most of their attention to Management. For those interested in studying Management alongside Arts subjects, the <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/management-ma/index.html">MA in Management</a> may be of interest instead of the BSc.</p>

<p>From there, you will be able to explore a wide range of specialist subjects at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. Special subjects may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>advertising and marketing communications</li>
<li>corporate social responsibility, accountability and reporting</li>
<li>entrepreneurship and small business development</li>
<li>human resource management</li>
<li>international banking</li>
<li>sustainable development and management.</li>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Teaching is delivered through lectures; class sizes are around 200 to 300 students at sub-honours level and 20 to 170 students at Honours level.</p>
<p>Lectures are often supplemented by small-group tutorials of around 15 students. These tutorials are structured around material that coordinates with lectures, and are small enough that tutors can give special attention to particular needs.</p>
<p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Management. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Management staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/management/">School of Management website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Management, optional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Students’ progress is carefully monitored through a system of continuous assessment and tutorials. All Management modules are assessed by at least 30% coursework, with a balance made up of either written examinations or more coursework.</p>
<p>Written examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</span></strong></p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Management may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://themngsociety.wixsite.com/usta">Management Society</a>&nbsp;organises an innovative programme of events offering valuable personal development and networking opportunities.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7295/">Entrepreneur Society</a>&nbsp;promotes and nurtures entrepreneurship in the St&nbsp;Andrews community and beyond.
