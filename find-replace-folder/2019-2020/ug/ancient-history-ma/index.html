  <p>The MA (Hons) in Ancient History explores the history of Greece and Rome, and neighbouring peoples such as the Persians and Carthaginians. Students study the period from the beginning of Greek writing and urbanism in eighth century BCE through to the collapse of the western Roman empire in the fifth century CE. Geographically the subject is centred on the Mediterranean world, but at times extends from the Persian Gulf to the Clyde and from the Crimea to the Sahara.</p>
<p>Thematically, the course deals not only with political and military history, but also with topics such as gender and sexuality, slavery, colonization, religion, cultural contacts between peoples, and the ecology and economy of the ancient Mediterranean. Students will also study the nature of ancient evidence and the way that the Greeks and Romans represented the past and reinvented it to meet their changing needs.</p>

              <p>The MA (Hons) in Ancient History is a four-year course run by the School of Classics. In the first year, no previous experience of ancient history or classical languages is required; any student is eligible to take Ancient History. The history of the ancient Greek world is traced from the eighth century BCE to Alexander the Great, and the history of Rome is studied from its beginnings to the Emperor Augustus. Modules introduce political, social and archaeological aspects of civilisations that contributed much to later European culture.</p>
<p>Alongside Ancient History, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>In your second year you will undertake advanced study of the social, economic, administrative and religious history of the Roman Empire from Augustus to Constantine. You will also study the history of human settlement in the Mediterranean throughout classical antiquity. The rise and fall of classical civilisation is examined, with particular emphasis on archaeological evidence and the theories and interpretative models that modern historians have brought to bear on antiquity. These modules bridge the gap to Honours through focused assessment methods, including deeper analysis and practical tutorials using the University’s archaeological collections.</p>
<p>At Honours-level, you will be able to branch out and study a wide range of topics in Ancient History that cover key aspects of the social, economic, political and cultural history of the Greek and Roman world, from archaic Greece to the end of the Roman empire. All of the School’s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes, such as slavery, religion, gender, warfare and imperialism.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Typically, you will take one Ancient History module per semester during your first two years, and two modules per semester during your third and fourth year (known as Honours).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8"><div id="year-tabs-container"><ul class="nav nav-tabs"><li class="active" role="presentation"><a href="#modules-year-1" data-toggle="tab" data-unsp-sanitized="clean">First year</a></li><li role="presentation"><a href="#modules-year-2" data-toggle="tab" data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Second year</a></li><li role=&gt;presentation&lt;><a href="#modules-year-3" data-toggle="tab" data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Honours</a></li></ul><div id="year-tabs" class="tab-content"><div id="modules-year-1" class="tab-pane fade active in"><p>Students will take the following compulsory first-year modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Greeks in a Wider World</strong>: surveys Greek history from the origins of the Greek city-states in the Archaic period (ca. 800 BCE), through the heyday of Athens’ empire and democracy in the fifth century, to Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire. Alongside political and military history, the module tackles topics such as religious belief, sexuality, and Greek interactions with other peoples of the ancient Mediterranean world.</li>
<li><strong>Rome and the Mediterranean</strong>: traces Rome’s trajectory from a small settlement in central Italy to the centre of a Mediterranean empire. The module examines a wide range of topics, including politics, the family, religion, slavery, poverty and the economy. It exposes the links between the growth of Rome’s power abroad and the transformation and eventual collapse of its Republican government at home.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>Second year compulsory modules in Ancient History are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Mediterranean Communities</strong>: </strong>examines the human settlement and material culture of the entire Mediterranean world throughout classical antiquity, tracing the transformation of the Mediterranean from a world of tiny peasant and tribal communities to a world of complexly connected cities, states and empires.</li>
<li><strong>The Roman Empire</strong>: explores the complex history of the Roman Empire from Augustus to Late Antiquity, an empire which, for the first and last time, united the whole Mediterranean and its diverse hinterlands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students can replace one or both of these modules with second-year Classical Studies modules in order to adapt the programme to suit their interests. Second year modules in Classical Studies are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture and Thought in the Late Roman Republic</strong>: studies the art and literature of Rome in the Late Republic (first century BCE). Key literary texts, such as the passionate poetry of Catullus and the stylish rhetoric of Cicero, are set against the broader backdrop of Roman political, cultural and social life in this turbulent period of civil war and dictatorship.</li>
<li><strong>Early Greek Poetry and Philosophy</strong>: surveys the very origins of Western civilisation in the archaic and early classical Greek world. The module studies the diversity of early Greek thought through the poetry and philosophy of the period, and explores themes of conflict, love and the relationship between mortals and gods.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>Ancient History students must take the core module&nbsp;<strong>Approaches to Ancient History</strong> in their third year. In addition, you will choose from a variety of advanced options, including modules from a wide range of periods that showcase different historical approaches. You will also have access to modules from the Ancient History &amp; Archaeology and Classical Studies programmes, which will give you an even wider choice of social, cultural and historical topics to explore.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Culture of Roman Imperialism</li>
<li>Eight Scenes from the Life of Alexander the Great</li>
<li>Greeks and Others</li>
<li>Persia and the Greeks</li>
<li>Religious Communities in the Late Antique World</li>
<li>Roman Slavery.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fourth year, students also undertake a 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The sub-honours modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in.

<p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (70 to 120 students) and small group tutorials (8 to 12 students). Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by an expert tutor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Honours level, all teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>
<p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading ancient source material in translation</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Ancient History. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of seminars and workshops under the supervision of the module co-ordinator.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/staff/">staff in the School of Classics</a> on the School of Classics website.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Ancient History may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7240/">The Bacchae Society</a>&nbsp;is the student society for everyone with an interest in all things classical.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6068/">The Student Archaeological Society</a> promotes, supports and develops students’ interest in archaeology and archaeological activity.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209948925/?fref=ts">The Greek and Cypriot Society</a>&nbsp;welcomes everyone with an interest in Greece, Greek history and culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and St Salvator’s quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, and individual meetings with tutors in this building, while lectures are usually held in St Salvator’s.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes.&nbsp;It is a lovely additional study space for students in the School.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
