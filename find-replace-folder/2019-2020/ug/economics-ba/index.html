              <p>The BA (International Hons) in Economics is a four-year course run jointly by the School of Economics and Finance at St Andrews and the Department of Economics at the <a href="http://www.wm.edu/as/economics/">College of William &amp; Mary.</a></p>
<p>You will study for two years at both St Andrews and William &amp; Mary, spending the first year of the programme at one institution and the second year at the other. You will then be able to choose where you wish to spend your third and fourth years of study and graduate from either university.</p>
<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>If you study a BA (International Honours) in Economics, you will learn to reduce complicated problems to their important components, formulate solutions, and apply up-to-date theoretical ideas as a framework for understanding the real world.</p>
<p>The economics departments of the two universities complement each other very well. Both departments have strengths in applied economic theory. Economics at St Andrews has particular strengths in dynamic macroeconomics, finance, household economics, climate change, and competition and innovation. Economics at William &amp; Mary has particular strengths in the areas of health, experimental and international economics.</p>
<p>The BA (International Honours)&nbsp;is a broadly based degree, and other combinations – such as joint Honours degrees – are not available with this programme. However, during the programme you will have opportunities to study a range of other subjects offered by both institutions.

              <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>Students on the BA Economics programmes will be able to choose a greater variety of modules than would normally be available to other students. Available subjects vary from year to year and depend upon the strengths of each institution, but often include modules in financial economics, development economics, international economics, inequality, environmental economics, and so on. You also benefit from having access to two sets of staff who are dedicated teachers as well as active researchers.</p>
<p>Honours students take a number of core subjects (such as microeconomics, macroeconomics and econometrics), but also typically choose from a number of available optional modules.</p>
<p>Students will also benefit from study under two distinct educational traditions and by being part of a unique and diverse community. By the end of your degree you should have friends and contacts from many different places in the world and from a number of different backgrounds.</p>
<p>In addition, the BA (International Honourss) degree is classified according to both UK and US practice, which means the quality of your degree should be understood by potential employers and universities on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>At St Andrews, first and second year modules generally involve a series of lectures (100 to 350 students), laboratories and small-group tutorials (15 to 20 students) designed to facilitate effective interaction.</p>
<p>In third or fourth year, modules are taught through lectures (10 to 140 students) and smaller group tutorials (10 to 20 students). Students typically attend seven to eight lectures and one to two tutorials or labs a week.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students at St Andrews are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on individual and group projects</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undertaking research in the library</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing coursework assignments and presentations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing for examinations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>At St Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Economics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to your studies in the School, optional </span><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the </span></strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules in Economics at St Andrews are assessed by a combination of graded work and examinations. Almost all of the modules are assessed by at least 50% written exams with the balance of assessment made up by coursework.</p>
<p>Coursework takes the form of essays, along with other kinds of assessed work including oral presentations and group projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examinations at St Andrews are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Economics and Finance provides feedback on every assessment with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</span></p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Economics may be interested in joining the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/econsoc/">St&nbsp;Andrews Economic Society</a>. This active society is run by students and holds regular career events, essay competitions and social occasions. The society also publishes&nbsp;<a href="https://thestandrewseconomist.com/">The St&nbsp;Andrews Economist</a>, a magazine covering current affairs, academic theory, economic policies, and trends.</p>
<p>The School of Economics and Finance is located in Castlecliffe on The Scores in a beautiful Edwardian mansion overlooking St&nbsp;Andrews Bay, next to the ruins of St&nbsp;Andrews Castle on the Fife coast.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
