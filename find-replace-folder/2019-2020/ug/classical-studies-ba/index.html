              <p>The BA (International Hons) in Classical Studies is a four-year course run jointly by the School of Classics at St Andrews and the Department of Classical Studies at the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/classicalstudies/">College of William &amp; Mary.</a></p>
<p>You will study for two years at both St Andrews and William &amp; Mary, spending the first year of the programme at one institution and the second year at the other. You will then be able to choose where you wish to spend your third and fourth years of study and graduate from either university.</p>
<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>If you study a BA (International Honours) in Classical Studies, you will choose between two pathways: Greek and Latin, or Ancient History and Archaeology.</p>
<p>If you choose the Greek and Latin pathway, you will be able to take both Greek and Latin at complete beginners' level or at more advanced level if you have substantial previous experience.</p>
<p>If you choose the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway, you will be introducted to, and provided advanced training in, the material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BA (International Honours)&nbsp;is a broadly based degree, and other combinations – such as joint Honours degrees – are not available with this programme. However, during the programme you will have opportunities to study a range of other subjects offered by both institutions.

              <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>This programme offers an impressive range of modules that students can take without losing the depth of focus by following either a language or Ancient History and Archaeology pathway.</p>
<p>Working together, the Classics departments from both universities offer a unique range of modules. For example, students are able to pursue coursework in Etruscan archaeology and Egyptology (at William &amp; Mary) as well as modules in Late Antique and Bronze Age Archaeology (at St Andrews): this unusual combination of modules is hard to find in any single department. The programme also provides Greek and Latin language students with a more flexible degree, one which can be tailored to your level of study between the two institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undertaking a Classics degree in both campuses will also allow students a wider range of postgraduate opportunities in the North American and United Kingdom. As a student on the programme, you will have the unique advantage of knowing the UK and US systems well should you wish to make postgraduate applications.</p>

<p>Students at St Andrews for their first or second year will be taught through a mixture of lectures, seminars, language classes and set-text reading classes.</p>
<p>In third or fourth year, all teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students at St Andrews are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading Greek or Latin texts</li>
<li>practising language and translation skills</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>At St Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Greek, Latin, and Classics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all&nbsp;Classical Studies staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/staff/">School of Classics website</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to your studies in the School, optional </span><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules in Classical Studies at St Andrews are assessed by a mixture of coursework and written exams. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>research essays</li>
<li>literary criticism and commentary exercises</li>
<li>class tests, including unseen translation and grammar exercises</li>
<li>source analysis</li>
<li>learning diaries</li>
<li>oral presentations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of Classics provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module.

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Classical Studies may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6439/">The History Society</a> hosts guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6418/">The Greek and Cypriot Society</a> welcomes everyone with an interest in Greece, Greek history and culture.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6068/">The Student Archaeological Society</a> promotes, supports and develops students’ interest in archaeology and archaeological activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and main quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in this building, while lectures are held nearby in St Salvator’s quadrangle.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
