              <p>ScotGEM is a unique and innovative four-year graduate entry medicine programme run by the universities of St&nbsp;Andrews and Dundee. Our collaboration with four health boards: NHS Fife, Tayside, Highland and Dumfries and Galloway, along with the University of Highlands and Islands, allows us to deliver a truly distinctive programme.</p>
<p>The programme addresses all core MBChB requirements as stipulated by the General Medical Council (GMC). Whilst, ScotGEM is focused on enthusing graduates to become generalist practitioners with experience in rural health care, the programme will prepare students for any branch of medicine through the normal postgraduate training process.</p>
<p>The ambition of ScotGEM is to produce a cohort of high quality, adaptable and compassionate clinical leaders who will contribute to local communities and the health service whilst training through supported 'Agents of Change' projects in all four years.</p>
<p>Agents of Change goes beyond the core required by the GMC. It will enable ScotGEM students to learn, and attempt to bring, about real change in health care delivery. This aspect of the course is based on five themes that will run throughout the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>informatics</li>
<li>quality improvement</li>
<li>prescribing and therapeutics</li>
<li>public health</li>
<li>community engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents of Change helps learners understand, develop and practise the skills required to generate change in complex systems.&nbsp;It will involve taught materials, visiting speakers and related project work to help students develop their expertise. For example, students might work within a group of general practices to research and analyse prescribing patterns before helping to implement improvements. Agents of Change represents the majority of the ‘student selected’ element of the programme and is also a key opportunity to develop related scholarly outputs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an intensive graduate programme, whereby students are expected to study and work long terms (around 40 weeks per year). From second year onwards, components of the programme will include periods of living and studying in rural areas of the Highlands and Dumfries and Galloway. You must be prepared to live and study in this context.</p>

For example, a case of sore throat might lead into examination of the throat and neck, related anatomy, microbiology, pharmacology and related public health issues.</p>
<p>The complexity and challenge of the cases builds as you and your peers become more effective learners. Case-related clinical and communication skills will be introduced alongside topics such as biochemistry, pharmacology and anatomy.</p>
<p>Semester 1 will use cases that focus on foundational medical sciences; this knowledge will subsequently underpin more challenging scenarios.</p>
<p>Semester 2 concentrates on the body systems where examination skills can be learnt in conjunction with the relevant regional anatomy.</p>
<p>During this year, for one day a week, you will be engaged in small-group, work-based learning supported by a dedicated team of GP teachers or ‘generalist clinical mentors’ in a local general practice. This will include regular clinical experience and patient contact from the outset.</p>
<p>Agents of Change projects will include a voluntary sector placement and prescribing improvement project.</p></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>This year introduces a further 20 patient scenarios structured around the lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teaching in Year 2&nbsp;is delivered across three regions, enabling placements in Fife, Inverness, and Dumfries. Teaching will take place simultaneously across the three regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be prepared to live and study away from St&nbsp;Andrews for between 12 to 24 weeks during Year 2. The location of your study will be based on regional quota and student preference, if possible.</p>
<p>Student accommodation will be provided for placements outside Fife.</p>
<p>You will continue to work for&nbsp;one day each week with a generalist clinical mentor in the GP setting and spend an additional half a day in a specialist clinical environment. Year 2 closes by providing experience of unscheduled care (GP, emergency department, ambulance, etc) and project work related to Agents of Change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>In Year 3, you will undertake a 'longitudinal integrated clerkship' (LIC) where you will join a general practice over the course of a year rather than taking part in ‘traditional’ clinical rotations. This apprenticeship-style educational model allows you to follow patients through their illness journeys.</p>
<p>Approximately half of your week is spent consulting with patients, the remainder studying the conditions you have encountered or following your patients into the secondary care setting. This approach works especially well for graduate learners and has been shown to develop more patient-centred doctors with improved decision-making skills.</p>
<p>Agents of Change activities run in parallel with your clinical learning during this period.</p>
<p>LIC placements will be available in all four partner health board areas, but the majority will be in rural areas and weighted towards Highland and Dumfries and Galloway. You must be prepared to live and study away from Fife and Tayside.</p></div><div id="modules-year-4" class="tab-pane fade"><p>As a competent generalist student, you will now be immersed in the hospital environment and prepare yourself for work as a junior doctor. You will complete two month-long foundation apprenticeships and other hospital-based clinical attachments in final preparation for practice as a Foundation Year&nbsp;1&nbsp;doctor.</p>
<p>You may choose clinical areas of particular interest which you can experience in greater depth. You will also arrange an eight-week clinical elective period which can take place anywhere in the world and will be focused on your own objectives.</p>
<p>You will also conduct a one-month healthcare improvement project in a hospital setting.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>ScotGEM uses a wide range of teaching methods, much of which will be delivered within an NHS setting. A case-based learning approach in the first two years will prepare you for an exciting range of clinical learning opportunities in third and fourth years.</p>
<p>The ScotGEM course will be based on clinical cases from the outset. These will be supported by a set of learning objectives, lectures, practical classes, tutorials, simulated and ‘real’ clinical and consultation skills plus extensive supported independent and peer-peer learning.</p>
<p>Your learning will be underpinned by a sophisticated online Curriculum Management System, which will give access to a wide range of resources and enable progress to be monitored, particularly during Year 2 when the students will be located in different regions. For instance, regular online self-assessment tests and workplace based learning assessments will be required.</p>
<p>Increasingly, learning will become more self-directed, and you will be reliant upon yourself and your peers to explore, investigate and learn from the cases (still guided by clear learning objectives and with synchronised centrally organised teaching). This approach will set you up well for learning based on real patients in the clinical environment.</p>
<p>The longitudinal integrated clerkship in Year 3 will allow you to join a clinical team and learn whilst becoming increasingly involved in patient care. You will select patients to follow through and study them, their conditions and their care in more detail. Where relevant, you will attend specialist clinics, operations, etc as you follow these individuals’ journey through the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Finally, in Year 4, you will experience intensive hospital attachments that involve shadowing foundation doctors and other secondary care attachments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Each year will require you to pass assessments of knowledge, clinical skills and a portfolio demonstrating professional development.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Years 1 and 2, you will be assessed on your knowledge using a mix of online multiple choice questions and short answer written assessments. Year 3 will use online multiple choice questions aligned with the planned General Medical Council common exam (Medical Licencing Assessment).<br><br></li>
<li>In every year, there will be a portfolio assessment based on a mixture of engagement with learning, workplace-based performance and project work related to the curriculum themes.<br><br></li>
<li>In every year, there will be an Objective Structured Clinical Examination.</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessments will be selected specifically for the ScotGEM course, but draw heavily upon those available within both medical schools. Thus, your progress will be benchmarked against existing UK standards throughout.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Students must pass all of their modules each year in order to progress to the subsequent year.</p>
