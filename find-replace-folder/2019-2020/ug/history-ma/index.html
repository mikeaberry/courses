              <p>The MA (Hons) in History is a four-year course run by the School of History.&nbsp;In the first two years, you will have the opportunity to study from a broad chronological span, taking modules in at least two different historical periods.</p>
<p>The skills you gain in analysing original and secondary source materials will prepare you to continue exploring a wide range of historical subjects at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to dive deeper into a specialist topic of your choice during your fourth year.</p>
<p>Alongside History, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional one or two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>Breadth of knowledge and perspective are highly encouraged, and all students are expected to take some modules in other subject areas in their first two years, for example, English, art history or anthropology.</p>
<p>Graduates in History from St&nbsp;Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge in history and be able to make connections across different time periods and between different cultures.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Scotland, Britain and Empire (c. 1500-2000)</strong>: provides an introduction to how and why the British nation state evolved from the separate kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland and how and why it has survived over the last three centuries.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>If you decide to take History in your third and fourth years, you choose modules from a wide variety of advanced options.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age of Conquest: Edward I - Scotland and Wales (1239-1307)</li>
<li>The Decline and Fall of the French Old Regime (1715-1789)</li>
<li>The Formation of Islamic Iran: From the Arab Conquests to the Seljuq Empire (600-1200)</li>
<li>Heretics and Social Outcasts in Western Europe</li>
<li>The Mediaeval Castle</li>
<li>Power without Responsibility? The British Press and Politics (1850-1939).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some modules at Honours level are intended to build your portfolio and provide you with career experience. For example, the Recording the Past module allows you to submit a multimedia historical project in the form of a radio programme, video documentary, website or another appropriate medium.</p>
<p>In fourth year, students may also undertake a dissertation of around 10,000 to 12,000 words on a topic of their choice or an Honours project. These modules based on independent research enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p class="p1">The sub-honours modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St&nbsp;Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in.

<p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (usually 100 to 300 students) and small group tutorials (6 to 8 students). Lectures are given by all members of the School, enabling students to hear active researchers in each field talk about their specialism. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teaching at Honours level moves away from large group lecturing. Students meet in groups of about 10 to 15 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of History. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of&nbsp;classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/staff/staffindex.html">History staff</a> on the School of History website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of History, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of History may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6068/">Archaeological Society</a> is for those interested in anything from ancient weaponry to Indiana Jones. The society organises bi-weekly meetings (featuring guest speakers), social events, movie nights, and day trips to archaeological sites.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6439/">History Society</a> hosts talks with guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of History occupies three sites all within a few minutes’ walk of each other at the heart of the historic town of St&nbsp;Andrews. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in these buildings, while larger lectures are located in nearby buildings. The School of History sites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>St Katharine’s Lodge, a 19th-century former school near the seafront</li>
<li>New Arts Building, a modern building with lecture classrooms and study spaces</li>
<li>St John’s House, located on South Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
