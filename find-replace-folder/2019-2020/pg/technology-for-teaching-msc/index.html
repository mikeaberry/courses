              <p>The MSc in&nbsp;Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) with a Specialism for Technology in Teaching is designed to be useful to both experienced English language teachers as well as those considering a career in English language teaching. It is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in technology for teaching.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus your studies in your particular area of interest, and gain a better theoretical and practical understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to technology for teaching.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Take a specific&nbsp;Technology for Teaching module, conduct research in this area as part of an Action Research module, and choose a dissertation topic to research further into the field of technology for teaching.</li>
<li>Join experienced practitioners and scholars in the English language teaching community, with opportunities to be involved in ongoing professional development events and&nbsp;the annual <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/elt/eapconference/">English for Academic Purposes (EAP) conference</a>.</li>
<li>Integrate theory and practice – discuss theoretical concepts and frameworks in small groups and apply these through practical assessments and peer teaching sessions.</li>
<li>Engage in, and reflect on, a new language learning experience as part of the programme to gain a 360 degree perspective on language teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>You will take a variety of taught modules over the first two semesters of the programme, which are delivered through a mix of lectures, seminars, tutorials and out-of-class activities.</p>
<p>In these modules, you will integrate theory and practice by discussing and critiquing theoretical concepts and frameworks, and then applying them through a range of practical assessments. Assessments will include written assignments, presentations, the development of teaching plans, and observed teaching sessions.</p>

<li><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>:&nbsp;introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices&nbsp;of technology in language education. You are able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.<br><strong><br></strong></li>
<li><strong>Action Research for Teachers:&nbsp;</strong>provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>:&nbsp;explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the classroom. This is essential for all those seeking to understand their teaching environment more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Linguistics for Language Teachers</strong>:&nbsp;is designed to equip you with the skills required to describe and analyse written discourse. It does not assume prior knowledge of linguistics and seeks to introduce you to selected fundamental concepts, relevant to English language teaching. You acquire appropriate terminology and techniques in the analysis and description of grammatical terms and structures.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Teaching and Researching</strong>:&nbsp;helps you understand the features of a rigorous research question in the field of TESOL, as well as consider how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. The module also includes guidance and discussion on the different ethical considerations when conducting classroom-based research, as well as the important stages in writing up a dissertation.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Second Language Acquisition</strong>:&nbsp;focuses on how subsequent languages are learnt after the first language by exploring the development of SLA theory. You will&nbsp;then consider how this theory informs teaching.&nbsp;</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>You will choose two optional modules from the following list:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>:&nbsp;provides students with a detailed understanding of the key concepts behind different methods of testing and evaluation in English language teaching and learning.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>:&nbsp;provides you with an understanding of the controversies&nbsp;of English as an international language for academic study, and the complexity involved in the use of English as a language of instruction from the standpoint of both the academic subject instructors and students who are using English as an L2. <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition,&nbsp;namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11 and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year, and some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University's position on <a href="index.html#d.en.40291">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>You will choose a topic of interest to you and to your future career in the field of&nbsp;technology for teaching and will read related literature and conduct independent research on your topic.</p>
<p>Student dissertations will be supervised by members of the teaching team with expertise in technology for teaching. Supervisors will provide guidance throughout the research process, helping you to formulate a suitable research hypothesis and offering advice&nbsp;on relevant literature and how to plan your time effectively.</p>
<p>The completed dissertation of no more than 15,000 words must be submitted by a specified date in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose not to complete the dissertation required for the award of an MSc, there are exit awards available that allow suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2019 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>
