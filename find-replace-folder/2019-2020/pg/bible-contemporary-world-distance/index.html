<p>For those commencing in January 2020, the course starts with a study week in St Andrews from Monday&nbsp;20 to Friday&nbsp;24 January 2020.</p>
<p>If you started this programme in 2018, you can find information about 2018 entry on the <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/2018-2019/pg/bible-contemporary-world-distance/">2018 Bible and the Contemporary World &ndash; Distance Learning page</a>. Information about all programmes from previous years of entry can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/">archive</a>.</p>

          <h3>Course duration</h3>
          <p>15 weeks part time (single module); minimum 18 months part time, maximum 4 years part time (PGDip); minimum 2 years part time, maximum 5 years part time (MLitt) 
</p>

          <h3>Entry requirements</h3>
          <p>The School of Divinity encourages applications from those who have an undergraduate degree in any subject, and recognises that in some cases this may have been attained a number of years ago and that weaker performance at that time might not always indicate an applicant’s current academic potential.</p>
<p>A good 2.1 Honours undergraduate degree is normally expected, but if your degree classification is lower, you should indicate more recent, perhaps informal, learning in your letter of intent. You do not need to have a degree in Theology or Biblical Studies in order to apply for a place on this programme; however, all applicants will be expected to have sufficient knowledge to equip them for postgraduate level of study in this area. Prospective applicants who are unable to offer a 2.1 Honours degree are invited to have discussions in advance with the course director:&nbsp;email <a href="mailto:divinitydistance@st-andrews.ac.uk">divinitydistance@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p>If you studied your first degree outside the UK, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/">international entry requirements</a>.</p>
<p>English language proficiency. See&nbsp;<a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20ELT%20%BB%20Language%20requirements%20%BB%20Postgraduate" href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/elt/entry/postgraduate/">English language tests and qualifications</a>.</p>
<p>The qualifications listed are indicative minimum requirements for entry. Some academic Schools will ask applicants to achieve significantly higher marks than the minimum. Obtaining the listed entry requirements will not guarantee you a place, as the University considers all aspects of every application including, where applicable, the writing sample, personal statement, and supporting documents.</p>

              <p>The PGDip/MLitt in Bible and the Contemporary World is a part-time distance learning programme aimed at both lay people seeking personal development and clergy seeking continued professional development.</p>
<p>Find out more about <a href="http://bcw.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">studying Bible and the Contemporary World</a>.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gain an understanding of how public issues and culture both shape and are shaped by Christian theology, biblical interpretation and practice.</li>
<li>Join an international and interdenominational group of 20 to 25 students, most of whom are lay people.</li>
<li>A residential study week in St&nbsp;Andrews starts each module with lectures and seminar discussions and allows you to meet your fellow participants and tutors.</li>
<li>Opens possibilities for future doctoral work in fields such as practical theology or for those who seek to deepen their critical thinking in careers (often in the voluntary sector) that have a religious dimension.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Each semester begins with a residential study week held at St Mary's College, the School of Divinity at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews. A typical residential study week includes lectures, seminars, sessions on using the Moodle and MMS internet platforms and study skills training. It is also a good opportunity for you to meet your distance learning peers and tutors in person.</p>
<p>Attendance is required at each study week from Monday through Wednesday, but students are encouraged to stay for the remainder of the week. You will need to pay for your own travel and accommodation costs to attend these mandatory study weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both MLitt and PGDip students take three taught modules over the course of their programme. Each module comprises 15 weeks of study (typically divided into four units) and focuses on independent learning.</p>
<p>In each unit of a module, students are supplied a number of scholarly articles and extracts from books which are supplemented by two written lectures available online in digital format; you will also have access to the library's extensive online subscriptions of journals and ebooks. In lieu of seminars, you will participate in online bulletin board discussions with your peers (not held in real time).</p>
<p>Students typically write four essays for each module (one for each unit) and receive written feedback. Students will have one personal tutorial (usually via online video messaging or telephone) with a tutor per module where they can discuss their recent essay.</p>
<p>The MLitt programme is followed by&nbsp;a 15,000-word dissertation submitted at the end of two years study. Students are assigned an individual supervisor for their dissertation, and meetings with supervisors are normally held via online video messaging or telephone.</p>
