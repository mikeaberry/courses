              <p>The medical degree programme is six years long; students graduating BSc (Hons) Medicine from St Andrews will progress to one of the University's <a href="partner-medical-schools/index.html">partner medical schools</a> in Scotland or England for the final three years. Applicants who are ‘overseas’ for fee purposes will progress to the Medical School at the University of Manchester.</p>
<p>The School of Medicine at St Andrews offers an integrated curriculum within a strong clinical context. In addition to exploring the foundations of medical science, it encourages the development of the professional attitudes, ethical understanding and decision-making skills required by the GMC and detailed in ‘Outcomes for Graduates’ and ‘Promoting Excellence’. The curriculum addresses the following core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competence – understanding of the scientific basis of medicine and an extensive anatomical and physiological understanding of the human body.</li>
<li>Professionalism – development of clinical skills, personal values, interpersonal skills and ethical awareness.</li>
<li>Reflection – monitoring self-awareness and decision-making through the completion of a portfolio.</li>
<li>Independence – encouragement of self-directed learning and an ability to cope with uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching is designed to encourage the application of medical sciences to clinical problems, and clinical teaching is integrated with the basic science learning and spans from first year to third year, running throughout the entire course. Clinical skills teaching, including communication skills, takes place in simulated wards and examination rooms. Clinical experience is also offered in the form of patient contact through primary care initiatives in the community from first year onwards. Professionalism and patient safety are key components of the entire course.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>The small size of the School (around 170 in each year group) allows staff to get to know students individually, and this encourages a friendly atmosphere. Students are allocated a tutor concerned with personal welfare and academic development as the School aims to provide a supportive environment in which all students thrive.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the School of Medicine has been housed in a £45m purpose-built Medical and Biological Sciences building which offers outstanding facilities for teaching, learning and research. Collaborations with key University disciplines, such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Psychology, add an important dimension to medical research and the training of research scientists and health care professionals.</p>
<p>The School of Medicine at St&nbsp;Andrews is one of the few in the United Kingdom that still offers full-body cadaveric dissection. The dissection room is purpose-built and equipped with state-of-the-art facilities; it is spacious and well-ventilated with 16 tables for full body dissection and room to display numerous excellent models and specimens. Technicians and medical staff are on hand to offer advice and assistance.</p>
<p>The clinical skills suite features 7 rooms containing 48 beds. All beds are equipped with ceiling-mounted video capture facilities and 'bed-head' touch screens to allow instant playback or video resources. The centre features a full range of real and simulated clinical equipment.</p>
<p>There is also the opportunity for students to join the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.butemedicalsociety.co.uk/">Bute Medical Society</a>, one of the University’s oldest, largest and most active student societies. They run regular events throughout the year as well as the annual Bute Medical Society Ball.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews.</a></p>
