  <p>The MA (Hons) in Russian teaches you to use Russian with sound grammatical accuracy and a high level of oral aptitude. In addition to language teaching, you will also be given a deeper and more diverse understanding and appreciation of different aspects of Russian culture through modules dedicated to literature, history and Russian society.</p>
<p>Russian at St Andrews uses a specially designed language teaching programme that caters both for students who have already studied Russian as a main subject at school and for absolute beginners. Upon completing the degree, you will have an excellent command of the Russian language and have gained an invaluable understanding and appreciation of the Russian-speaking world.</p>
<p>During your degree, you have the opportunity to spend time&nbsp;studying abroad in Russia. Time in Russia is not compulsory, but is strongly recommended as the best way to master the language and to better know the country.&nbsp;On a four-year degree, students can spend one semester in one of a variety of locations in Russia. The MA (Hons) in Russian is also available as a five-year course with an integrated year abroad when students spend time studying in Russian between their second and third years.&nbsp;<a href="integrated-year-abroad/index.html">Find out more about the Russian integrated year abroad</a>.</p>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>All Modern Language modules involve a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical languages classes. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small language tutorials allow you to actively work together with your tutors to practice language skills, present papers, and discuss texts and issues relevant to the course.</p>
<p>Sub-honours Russian modules are delivered through small language classes, with 15 to 30 students in each. Oral classes are generally held in smaller groups of no more than 15 students.</p>
<p>At Honours level, you will attend smaller language classes (5 to 15 students) and seminars (5 to 12 students).</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and language classes, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Russian. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Russian staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/russiandepartment/people/">School of Modern Languages website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the Department of Russian, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>

                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>All Russian modules are assessed by a combination of coursework (at least 40%) and end-of-semester examinations. Coursework includes advanced language exercises, discursive essays and oral presentations.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand. Examinations are either entirely in written format or comprise both written and oral components.</p>
<p>Tutors advise you closely on the preparation of written work and give individual assessments of your performance. The Department aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Russian may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/russocstandrews/">Russian Society</a>&nbsp;is dedicated to sharing Russian culture and language in Fife. They host events including poetry nights, film screenings, coffee gatherings and international food evenings.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAsocStA/">University of St Andrews Ukrainian Society</a> promotes Ukrainian culture in the University and the town. They host socials, cultural nights, cook-off and movie nights, and many other events.</li>
<li><a href="http://ahasoc.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">At Home and Abroad Society</a> promotes study and work abroad programmes along with all forms of international cultural exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Modern Languages is situated at the very centre of St Andrews in the Buchanan Building on Union Street. Within the Buchanan Building is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/multi-mediacentre/">Multimedia Centre</a>, a digital language lab which students will use as both a component of their module classwork and as part of individual study.</p>
<p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
