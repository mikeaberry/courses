  <p>The MA (Hons) in Film Studies offers a comprehensive study of global film cultures. Engaging the cultural, industrial and institutional contexts of global cinema, as well as analytical, media historical, political and phenomenological approaches to film scholarship, you will emerge with a powerful and relevant set of scholarly tools. Students critically examine the history of film and related media in their artistic, documentary and non-theatrical variants, from the pre-cinematic to the digital, looking at a diverse range of topics from stars to media activism, and from archives to film festivals.</p>

              <p>The MA (Hons) in Film Studies is a four-year course run by the Department of Film Studies. In the first two years, students are introduced to the key concepts, theories and methodologies of Film Studies as well as a variety of methodological and theoretical frameworks for the historical study of cinema and the visual media. This lays the foundation for more specialised and increasingly challenging modules offered at Honours level.</p>
<p>Alongside Film Studies, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about more about <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>The Honours syllabus reflects the research expertise of teaching staff, who are in many cases pre-eminent scholars in the field. Students work closely with the teaching staff, developing excellent intellectual, writing and research skills that are useful in a wide variety of professions.</p>
<p>Specialist subjects you may be able to take include:</p>
<ul>
<li>world cinemas and global genres (science fiction, crime film, etc)</li>
<li>film, human rights and activism</li>
<li>queer theory and gender identity</li>
<li>sensory cinema</li>
<li>colonial cinema</li>
<li>film and media history</li>
<li>film sound</li>
<li>stars</li>
<li>cinema in the digital era</li>
<li>film festivals.</li>
</ul>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

These range from film theories covering gender, national and transnational, and philosophical approaches to particular topics such as war and cinema, cinemas of India, and the European science fiction film. Students are encouraged to choose and develop their own specialisms and interests within the discipline of Film Studies.</p>
<p>Modules available will reflect current staff specialisms and therefore may vary year to year. Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modernity and the Moving Image</li>
<li>Film and Fashion</li>
<li>Film Sound</li>
<li>Images and Impact: Uses of Film</li>
<li>British Cinemas: Conventions, Subversions, and Outsiders.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fourth year, students also undertake a 10,000-word dissertation on an advanced topic in Film Studies. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The sub-honours modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in.

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through whole-class lectures (65 to 135 students), screenings and small group tutorials (5 to 12 students). Most teaching on film takes place in a lecture theatre equipped for the evening film screenings that accompany lectures.</p>
<p>Lectures are given by all members of the Department, enabling students to hear academics at the cutting edge of the discipline. Students receive the best and latest ideas and material to research and evaluate. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.</p>
<p>Extensive use is made of the University’s specialist library resources, including one of the best collections of international cinema on DVD, holding over 9,300 AV materials and including some extremely rare films and holdings.</p>
<p>Teaching at Honours level moves away from large group lecturing. Class sizes vary between modules, but students typically meet in groups of about 5 to 17 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and film screenings, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Film Studies. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</span></strong></p>
<p>You can find contact information for all film studies staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/filmstudies/about/who-are-we/">Department of Film Studies website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the Department of Film Studies, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>All sub-honours modules are assessed by a balance of coursework and written examinations held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>research essays</li>
<li>class presentations</li>
<li>source analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Honours level, the modules are entirely assessed on the basis of coursework.</p>
<p>The Department of Film Studies provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Film Studies may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StAndrewsFilmSoc/">Film Society</a> that holds weekly film screenings and regular pub nights.</p>
<p>The Department of Film Studies is centrally located in two buildings on North Street. These have been recently refurbished and boast bright office spaces and a well-equipped teaching room, as well as excellent screening equipment. For all Honours and Masters seminars, there are newly refurbished and specially equipped facilities (including 3D projection) at the <a href="http://byretheatre.com/">Byre theatre</a>. Lectures and screenings for the Department of Film Studies take place in the historical heart of the University in School 3, St Salvator’s Quad.</p>
<p>The Department is located next door to the local independent cinema, New Picture House, which screens popular films. Dundee, the closest city, boasts an excellent arthouse cinema at the Dundee Contemporary Arts centre.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews.</a></p>
