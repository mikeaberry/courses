  <p>The BSc (Hons) in Materials Chemistry seeks to understand the interrelationships between the composition, structure, microstructure and properties of matter in order to design and develop new materials – for example, semiconductor processing and fabrication; energy and IT; biomaterials; catalyst materials; ‘smart coatings’; and nanotechnology.</p>
<p>During your degree, you will be provided with a broad base of chemical knowledge and understanding reinforced by extensive practical experience and familiarity with modern laboratory, instrumental and computational techniques. You will obtain the necessary skills and experience for a career in chemistry, whether in industry, education or research.</p>
<p>Students interested in this course may also be interested in the <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/materials-chemistry-mchem/index.html">Materials Chemistry Integrated Masters course</a>, which allows you to graduate with a Master of Chemistry.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The BSc in Materials Chemistry is a four-year course run by the School of Chemistry. During the course, you will develop awareness and appreciation of the latest advances in Materials Chemistry in addition to the fundamentals of the subject. You will be provided with a broad base of chemical knowledge and understanding reinforced by extensive practical experience. In addition, you will get a high level of general intellectual and scientific training, which allows many graduates to enter challenging careers in areas not directly related to chemistry.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will take modules in organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. The skills you gain in research and analysis during these years will prepare you to undertake more advanced and specialist modules during your final two years. These specialist subjects include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>advanced solid-state chemistry</li>
<li>introduction to analysis of materials</li>
<li>energy conversion and storage</li>
<li>functional materials and electrons in solids</li>
<li>statistical mechanics and computational chemistry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside Materials Chemistry, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about more about <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>

<p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. Find out more about <a href="direct/index.html">direct entry to second year</a> for Materials Chemistry.</p>
<p>It is possible for students to take Materials Chemistry as a five-year Integrated Masters course, allowing you to graduate with a Master of Chemistry.

<p>Chemistry is taught through a combination of lectures (80 to 160 students) and labs (20 to 50 students), which are supplemented by small group tutorials (5 to 10 students). Class sizes decrease at Honours level.</p>
<p>All lecture courses have web-based support materials, and additional teaching support is given for selected topics, such as mathematics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the laboratory</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of materials chemistry. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>Find contact information for all Chemistry staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/chemistry/contact/">School of Chemistry website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Chemistry, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>

<p class="normal1">All sub-honours modules are assessed by 60% to 70% written examinations combined with 30% to 40% coursework covering laboratories, tutorials and transferable skills exercises.</p>
<p class="normal1">For Honours modules, assessment is either by written examination for lecture-based modules, or by coursework including written reports, oral presentations and oral examinations for laboratory, workshop and research project modules.</p>
<p class="normal1">Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of Chemistry provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p class="normal1">The School of Chemistry is located in the Purdie Building and the Biomedical Sciences Building in the North Haugh on the western edge of town. These buildings offer recently upgraded lecture theatres and seminar rooms, as well as state-of-the-art teaching laboratories for chemistry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>

The fact that it is an international School, in a student-driven town just adds to the overall experience.”</p>
