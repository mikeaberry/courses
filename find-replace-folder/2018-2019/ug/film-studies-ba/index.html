              <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>The Film Studies programmes at St Andrews and William &amp; Mary have much in common – a core grounded in the understanding of the form, history, and theory of the image, with an emphasis on “global” productions (i.e. outside of the USA or UK).</p>
<p>Both institutions offer courses in national (and transnational) cinemas, in film genre, and in the film industry; however, St Andrews offers a wider range of in-depth, film-specific courses at Honours level, including courses in areas such as archival research and the star system, while William &amp; Mary offers more interdisciplinary courses in media studies and related disciplines, such as photography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual Global Film Festival hosted by William &amp; Mary&nbsp;– a major international festival that incorporates important scholarly presentations – complements St Andrews’ important scholarship and publication series on film festivals.</p>
<p>The Centre for Film Studies at St Andrews provides opportunities for students to interact with visiting speakers and filmmakers and to participate in workshops and events. For example, over the past academic year, students at St Andrews have been importantly involved in the visits of Joe Russo, the director of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>; Tom Engelman, producer at Dreamworks; and with scholars such as William Brooker and Maria Pramaggiore. St Andrews has also staged practical collaborative workshop on topics like “Film and Music”.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>Students at St Andrews for their first or second year will be taught through whole-class lectures (65 to 135 students), screenings and small group tutorials (5 to 12 students). Most teaching on film takes place in a lecture theatre equipped for the evening film screenings that accompany lectures.</p>
<p>Lectures at St Andrews are given by all members of the Department, enabling students to hear academics at the cutting edge of the discipline. Students receive the best and latest ideas and material to research and evaluate. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.</p>
<p>Extensive use is made of the University’s specialist library resources, including one of the best collections of international cinema on DVD, holding over 9,300 AV materials and including some extremely rare films and holdings.</p>
<p>In third or fourth year, teaching moves away from large group lecturing. Class sizes vary between modules, but students typically meet in groups of about 5 to 17 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students at St Andrews are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Film Studies may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StAndrewsFilmSoc/">Film Society</a> which holds weekly film screenings and regular pub nights.</p>
<p>The Department of Film Studies is centrally located in two buildings on North Street. These have been recently refurbished and boast bright office spaces and a well-equipped teaching room, as well as excellent screening equipment. For all Honours and Masters seminars, there are newly refurbished and specially equipped facilities (including 3D projection) at the <a href="http://byretheatre.com/">Byre theatre</a>. Lectures and screenings for the Department of Film Studies take place in the historical heart of the University in School 3, St Salvator’s Quad.</p>
<p>The Department is located next door to the local independent cinema, New Picture House, which screens popular films. Dundee, the closest city, boasts an excellent arthouse cinema at the Dundee Contemporary Arts centre.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
