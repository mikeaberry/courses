  <p>The BSc (Hons) in Management Science&nbsp;introduces you to organisations in all sectors and teaches you to understand techniques which draw from the subject including marketing, organisational behaviour, managing in diverse and challenging situations, and analysing financial data. In addition, you receive advanced training in quantitative techniques that are relevant to the analysis of managerial problems.</p>
<p>In the School of Management, you learn from a team of international scholars whose teaching and research are based on the concept of responsible enterprise, which entails an ethical approach to managing organisations and their social and environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The Management Science BSc is particularly suited for those who want to give most of their attention to Management, as they acquire the skills to apply mathematics to Management.</p>

<p>Alongside Management Science, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>During your third and fourth years, you will be able to explore a wide range of specialist subjects, which may include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>scenario thinking</li>
<li>international banking</li>
<li>consumer behaviour</li>
<li>statistical modelling</li>
<li>advanced data analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>During your studies, you will obtain knowledge of international trends and develop interpersonal and transferable skills, as well as an orientation towards creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, you will take optional modules chosen from a wide range which reflects the expertise of staff in the School of Management and the School of Mathematics and Statistics. Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario Thinking</li>
<li>Financial Markets and Investments</li>
<li>Mathematical Programming</li>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Modules in Management are delivered through lectures with class sizes around 200 to 320 students at sub-honours level and 20 to 170 students at Honours level.</p>
<p>Lectures are often supplemented by small-group tutorials of around 15 students. These tutorials are structured around material that coordinates with lectures, and are small enough that tutors can give special attention to particular needs.</p>
<p>Mathematics modules are taught through lectures (100 to 250 students) supplemented by practical laboratory classes (25 to 60 students) and small group tutorials (8 to 12 students).</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the School of Management, you will be taught by leading researchers in the field with an emphasis on research-led teaching. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader. </span></strong></p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Management staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/management/aboutus/people/">School of Management website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Management, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Students’ progress is carefully monitored through a system of continuous assessment and tutorials.</p>
<p>All Management modules are assessed by at least 30% coursework, with a balance made up of either written examinations or more coursework. Mathematics modules are assessed by at least 50% written examination with the remainder made up of coursework.</p>
<p>Written examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>

Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
