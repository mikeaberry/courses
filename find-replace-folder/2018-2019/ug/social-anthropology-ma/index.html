  <p>The MA (Hons) in Social Anthropology explores&nbsp;the fundamental question of ‘what it is to be human’. It seeks to answer this by examining the diverse ways in which human beings establish and live social lives in the contemporary world.</p>
<p>Although Social Anthropology involves studying a full variety of human contexts, at St Andrews the chief focus is on societies in East and West Africa, the Pacific, South America, the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia.</p>

              <p>The MA (Hons) in Social Anthropology is a four-year course run by the Department of Social Anthropology. Social Anthropology at St Andrews has a distinctive orientation that combines interpretive, experiential, philosophical and historical research that is politically engaged, reflexive and critically aware.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will be introduced to the wide variety of societies that anthropologists study and some key theoretical approaches. This is a good opportunity to explore a number of different anthropological topics and to see where your interests lie.</p>
<p>Alongside Social Anthropology, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>During your final two years, you will build on what you have already learned and be able to advance into topics that suit individual interests. Specialist subject areas may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>visual anthropology</li>
<li>language and culture</li>
<li>anthropology and history</li>
<li>sex and gender</li>
<li>anthropology, literature and art</li>
<li>migration</li>
<li>resource extraction and energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modules in anthropological theory and research methods will prepare you to undertake a 10,000-word dissertation in your final year on a topic of interest chosen in consultation with teaching staff.</p>
<p>Graduates in Social Anthropology from St Andrews can expect to have a thorough grounding in the anthropological discipline, to have a broad learning of non-Western societies, and to be able to explore a variety of important themes in depth.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Social Anthropology sub-honours modules are primarily delivered through formal lectures (100 to 350 students) complimented by small group tutorials (10 to 12 students), workshops and ethnographic film screenings.</p>
<p>At Honours level, instruction is predominately through seminars (maximum 30 students) which combine elements of lectures, films, presentations and discussions.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and workshops, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Social Anthropology. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Social Anthropology staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/anthropology/dept/staff/">Department of Social Anthropology website</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the Department, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules in Social Anthropology are assessed by a combination of coursework (at least 40%) and written exams. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>essays</li>
<li>projects</li>
<li>take-home exams</li>
<li>student diaries and learning journals</li>
<li>creative writing</li>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Social Anthropology students may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anthrosoc/">Anthropology Society</a>, which aims to foster enthusiasm and curiosity towards studying humans around the world. The group hosts a range of events including lectures, workshops and socials.</p>
<p>The Department of Social Anthropology is located at the centre of the University in a three-storey building dating back to the 15<sup>th</sup> century. It is only a minute’s walk to the University Library and St Salvator’s College. Most of your lectures, seminars and tutorials will be held here or in nearby buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
