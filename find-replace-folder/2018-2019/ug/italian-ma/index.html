  <p>As an MA (Hons) student of Italian, you will develop language and communication skills to a high level of proficiency. You will also have the opportunity to engage with a number of specialist topics comprising Italian literature, culture, history, politics and film.</p>
<p>Italian is available to both beginners and non-beginners. Both cohorts are introduced to a wide spectrum of cultural and literary genres, from mediaeval texts and poetry to 20<sup>th</sup>-century Italian novels, films and more.</p>
<p>Language is taught at all levels in small groups, allowing teaching staff to pay close attention to progression. The Department’s innovative and distinctive teaching approach includes mixed skills and integrated classes, extensive use of contemporary audio-visual materials, and regular structured contact with native speakers. Students of Italian gain comprehensive transferrable skills relevant to a wide range of careers. At Honours levels, they are also introduced to professional areas like translation and interpreting.</p>
<p>During your third year, you have the opportunity to study abroad in Italy at one of the University’s Erasmus+ partners. The MA in Italian is also available as a five-year course with an integrated year abroad. The integrated year abroad is an opportunity for students to spend a year working in Italy between second year and third year, often as part of the British Council Language Assistantship scheme, thus gaining valuable experience as teachers and tutors. Students who spend a year abroad not only develop their linguistic skills, but also increase their intercultural competence, self-confidence, and future employability. <a href="integrated-year-abroad/index.html">Find out more about integrated year abroad options</a>.</p>

              <p>The MA (Hons) in Italian is a four-year course run by the School of Modern Languages. The course is available to both students who are beginners in Italian and to more advanced students who have studied Italian to A-Level or SQA Higher.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will learn and refine your understanding of Italian grammar and language through reading, writing, listening and speaking. Those with prior knowledge in Italian will further develop their language and writing skills, and both groups will be introduced to different aspects of Italian culture and history.</p>
<p>Alongside Italian, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>During your third year, you have the opportunity to study at one of the University’s Erasmus+ partner institutions in Italy (Padua, Turin, Venice or Verona). In this case, study undertaken in Italy replaces equivalent study in St&nbsp;Andrews. Studying abroad is optional.</p>
<p>If you choose to stay in the UK for both your third and fourth years, you will take language modules focused on communication skills, and can choose from a range of specialist cultural modules. Areas of study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian literature</li>
<li>Italian cinema</li>
<li>Italian cultural studies</li>
<li>Italian history.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graduates in Modern Languages from St&nbsp;Andrews can expect to have not only an advanced level of competency in language skills, but a highly developed appreciation for other cultures and peoples. Other transferable skills, including analysis, synthesis and communication skills, will prepare you for a career in almost any industry.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">Students may choose to spend an additional year working or studying in Italy. Find out more about the <a href="integrated-year-abroad/index.html">integrated year abroad for this course</a>.</div>
<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits.

<p>Students who are beginners in Italian are required to take the following compulsory modules in their first year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Italian Language: concentrates on grammar and usage through reading, writing, listening and speaking.</li>
<li>Italian Language (Elementary): builds on the Introduction to Italian Language module by increasing the student’s knowledge of, and ability to use, Italian.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who have an SQA Higher or a GCE A-level in Italian are required to take the following compulsory modules in first year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian Language Intermediate 1 and 2: the core language module each semester provides a thorough and structured revision of grammar and a consolidation of speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills through formal grammar classes and practical oral language classes.</li>
<li>Italian Geographies: aims to give students some sense of the complexity of modern Italy through the study of particular cultural phenomena which have played an important role in national identity formation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Italian Histories: give students a sense of the complexity of Italy's past through the study of literary texts from different historical periods considered in their different contexts.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade"><p>Second year modules are the same for all students regardless of any prior knowledge of Italian. Students are required to take the following compulsory modules in their second year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Second Level Italian: develops the language skills acquired in first year Italian modules and enables students to achieve an intermediate level in reading, writing, listening and speaking in Italian. Students are introduced to a selection of central Italian texts from a range of time periods (for example, Dante and Primo Levi).</li>
<li>Second Level Italian (Advanced): offers an intermediate language course for students who have passed the first semester module. It is designed to further consolidate students’ knowledge of Italian grammar and vocabulary, refine language skills and develop communication skills. Students will study a selection of central Italian texts and media from a range of time periods (for example, Machiavelli and 20<sup>th</sup>-century film).</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade"><p>If you take Italian in your third and fourth years, in addition to the compulsory language modules you will choose from a variety of advanced options which incorporate literary, historical and cultural studies into language learning.

<li>Dante Alighieri</li>
<li>Authority and Subversion in the Italian Renaissance</li>
<li>Venice</li>
<li>Black Italians</li>
<li>Fascism and Film</li>
<li>Migration and Transculturality in New Italian Narrative.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fourth year, students have the option of undertaking a dissertation of up to either 5,000 words or 10,000 words in length, written in English, on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p class="p1">The sub-honours modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject.

<p>All Modern Language modules involve a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical language classes. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small language tutorials allow you to actively work together with your tutors to practice language skills, present papers, and discuss texts and issues relevant to the course.</p>
<p>Sub-honours Italian modules are delivered through lectures (up to 100 students in first year, up to 40 in second year), language tutorials and practical classes (typically 12 to 15 students).</p>
<p>At Honours level, you will attend language tutorials and practical classes in groups of 8 to 10 students and seminars of 10 to 15 students.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and practical language classes you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>developing language skills</li>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a job market that is becoming increasingly global, competency in global languages is valued by employers across all sectors, including industry and business. They recognise that a modern languages degree shows wide cultural experience as well as other personal transferable skills needed in employment.</p>
<p>A work placement abroad fosters your capacity for effective teamwork in a new cultural environment, and among the personal attributes you will develop on the year abroad are self-confidence, independence, initiative and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>Recent Italian graduates have gone to work for companies in the UK and Italy. Some are working as teachers of modern languages in the UK, or are teaching English abroad. Others have taken further training or conversion courses to prepare for careers in translating and interpreting. Some examples of companies where Italian graduates have proceeded to work for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the British Council</li>
<li>HSBC’s executive training programme</li>
<li>Citibank</li>
<li>Christian Salvesen</li>
<li>Harper Collins</li>
<li>Glasgow City Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/careers/">Careers Centre</a> offers one-to-one advice to all students as well as a programme of events to assist students to build their employability skills.</p>

                <h3>Study abroad</h3>
<p>The University is delighted to offer undergraduates a number of exciting <strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/studyabroad/outgoingstudents/opportunitiesabroadandhowtoapply/workingabroad/">opportunities</a></strong> to apply to spend a semester or year abroad as part of a St&nbsp;Andrews degree programme. St&nbsp;Andrews is partnered with large and small institutions, ancient and young, across the globe. What unites all of our programmes is the quality of the academic provision, ensuring that participation in a <strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/csa-app/search.htm">St&nbsp;Andrews Study abroad programme</a></strong> opens the door to a new and valuable academic experience at another world-class institution. Study Abroad for credit is permitted on existing University-approved programmes only.</p>
<p>Students may choose to spend an additional year working or studying in Italy. Find out more about <a href="integrated-year-abroad/index.html">the integrated year abroad for this course</a>.</p>
<h3>Working abroad</h3>
<p>Completing a work placement abroad is a good opportunity to gain work experience in another culture or language and to enhance valuable skill sets. As part of specific degree programmes in Modern Languages, you may apply to undertake a <strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/studyabroad/outgoingstudents/opportunitiesabroadandhowtoapply/workingabroad/">work placement</a></strong> abroad for credit.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Italian may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ahasoc.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">At Home and Abroad Society</a> (AHAsoc) promotes study and work abroad programmes along with all forms of international cultural exchange.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ItalianSoc/">Italian Society</a> promotes and shares the languages, arts, literature, theatre, cuisine, history and politics of Italy alongside frequent social events.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Modern Languages is situated at the very centre of St&nbsp;Andrews in the Buchanan Building on Union Street. Within the Buchanan Building is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/multi-mediacentre/">Multimedia Centre</a>, a digital language lab which students will use as both a component of their module classwork and as part of individual study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
