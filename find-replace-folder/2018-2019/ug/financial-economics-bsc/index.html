  <p>The BSc (Hons) in Financial Economics provides a structured, cumulative and rigorous foundation of economic concepts, principles, analysis, techniques and knowledge. You will develop your analytical and decision-making abilities through training in quantitative and model-based methods of analysis. Over the course of study, students engage with a number of specialist topics including portfolio management, asset pricing and corporate finance.</p>
<p>Financial Economics is studied up to Honours level in both the Faculty of Science (BSc) and the Faculty of Arts (MA). Students who have a background in the Sciences or who wish to study Financial Economics alongside Science subjects at St&nbsp;Andrews should apply for the BSc. For those interested in studying Financial Economics alongside Arts subjects, the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/financial-economics-ma/index.html">MA (Hons) in Financial Economics</a>&nbsp;may be of interest.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The BSc (Hons) in Financial Economics is a four-year course run by the School of Economics and Finance. The School also offers an&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/financial-economics-ma/index.html">MA in Financial Economics,</a> which may be more suitable for students who wish to take Financial Economics alongside Arts subjects. The Financial Economics element within both the BSc and MA degree programmes is exactly the same.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will acquire a solid foundation in general knowledge of Economics. This includes an introduction to the principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics; an insight into quantitative techniques; and developing an understanding of economic relationships and the techniques necessary for their analysis.</p>
<p>At Honours level, you may select modules from a range of options on specific topics. These provide an analytical understanding of key aspects of finance, economics and government policy formation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside Financial Economics, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two.

<p>First and second year modules generally involve a series of lectures (200 to 350 students), laboratories and small-group tutorials (15 to 20 students) designed to facilitate effective interaction.</p>
<p>At Honours level, modules are taught through lectures (10 to 140 students) and smaller group tutorials (10 to 20 students). Students typically attend seven to eight lectures and one to two tutorials or labs a week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When not attending lectures, tutorials and workshops, you will be&nbsp;</span>expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on individual and group projects</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undertaking research in the library</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing coursework assignments and presentations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing for examinations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Financial Economics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to your studies in the School, optional </span><strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Progress is monitored through tutorial assignments and assessment is by a combination of graded work and examinations. Almost all of the modules are assessed by at least 50% written exams with the balance of assessment made up by coursework.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>Coursework takes the form of essays, along with other kinds of assessed work including oral presentations and group projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Economics and Finance provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future, and aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</span></p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Economics may be interested in joining the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standrewseconsoc.com/">St&nbsp;Andrews Economic Society</a>. This active society is run by students and holds regular career events, essay competitions and social occasions. The society also publishes&nbsp;<a href="https://thestandrewseconomist.com/">The St&nbsp;Andrews Economist</a>, a magazine covering current affairs, academic theory, economic policies, and trends.</p>
<p>The School of Economics and Finance is located in Castlecliffe on The Scores in a beautiful Edwardian mansion overlooking St&nbsp;Andrews Bay, next to the ruins of St&nbsp;Andrews Castle on the Fife coast.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
