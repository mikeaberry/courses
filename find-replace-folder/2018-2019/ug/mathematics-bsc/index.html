  <p>The BSc (Hons) in Mathematics will teach you to understand complex patterns and structures, and develop the tools with which to analyse them. Whether these patterns relate to physical or biological phenomena or the structure of mathematics itself, the primary aim is to describe, categorise, and understand the processes involved.</p>
<p>Students of Mathematics will acquire the analytical techniques, clear logical thinking and deductive reasoning necessary to explore some of these fascinating areas of research.</p>
<p>Mathematics is studied up to Honours level in both the Faculty of Science (BSc) and the Faculty of Arts (MA). Students who have a background in the sciences or who wish to study Mathematics alongside science subjects at St&nbsp;Andrews should apply for the BSc. For those interested in studying Mathematics alongside Arts subjects, the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/mathematics-ma/index.html">MA in Mathematics</a>&nbsp;may be of interest instead.</p>
<p>Students interested in the BSc degree may also be interested in the Integrated Masters courses in <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/mathematics-mmath/index.html">Mathematics</a>, <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/pure-mathematics-mmath/index.html">Pure Mathematics</a> or <a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/applied-mathematics-mmath/index.html">Applied Mathematics</a>, which allow you to graduate with a Master in Mathematics.</p>

<p>In first year, teaching for each module centres on a daily lecture (100 to 250 students) and a weekly small group tutorial (8 to 12 students) where students undertake exercises and discuss each week’s topics. In addition, computer labs (25 to 60 students) are held once a week for each module to assist with both computing and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>In second year, each module typically comprises five lectures (100 to 250 students), one tutorial (8 to 12 students), one computer lab (25 to 60 students), and one examples class (25 to 60 students) per fortnight.</p>
<p>You will develop increasing independence and initiative as you progress through your degree programme so that by third and fourth year the average teaching load drops to around ten hours of lectures and four tutorials per week, supplemented by private study.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and computer labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparing coursework assignments</li>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Mathematics and Statistics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials, examples classes and computing classes under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Mathematics staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/maths/">School of Mathematics and Statistics website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a></p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Progress is monitored through tutorial assignments, and sub-honours modules are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and written exams. At Honours level modules may be assessed by written examination alone or a combination of written examination and coursework.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School of Mathematics and Statistics aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/2017-18/USHFMTHSMTH.html?1504170133596">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p class="normal1">Students of Mathematics may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/StAndrews.SUMS/">Mathematics Society (SUMS)</a>, a society dedicated to bringing people together who are interested in maths. They hold regular socials and informative talks from guest speakers.</p>
<p>The School of Mathematics and Statistics is currently split between two sites – the Mathematical Institute on the North Haugh and the Scott Lang Building at the Observatory. Most of the Statistics staff and research students can be found at the Observatory.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>
