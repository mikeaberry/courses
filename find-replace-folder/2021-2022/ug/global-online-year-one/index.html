<p>Global Online Year One is an integrated pre-degree programme designed to give you certainty in uncertain times. Taking a combination of subject-specific first-year classes along with specialist academic skills, GOYO enables you to choose your study location and take classes online for the full 2020-2021 academic year.</p>
<p>Successful students can achieve a Certificate of Higher Education from St Andrews or progress onto the second year of a degree in St Andrews in September 2021.</p>
<p>On GOYO, students will study specialist academic skills and first-year subject-specific classes. This combination is designed to develop students’ intellectual and communication skills in line with the demands of an undergraduate degree programme. Taking advantage of some of the flexibility a St Andrews degree offers, students can study two academic subjects each semester.</p>

                <p>Global Online Year One is a pre-degree programme taught fully online. Designed to give certainty in a year of travel and movement restrictions around the world, the programme is based on providing a high-quality educational experience that students can then use to progress directly into the second year of a degree at St Andrews.</p>
<p>In each of the two semesters, students will study a core academic skills module, delivered by our International Education Institute, alongside two first-year level modules taught by our academic Schools (or two academic skills modules and one subject module).</p>
<p>During GOYO, students will take modules in the academic subjects relevant to their intended Honours degree. These subject-specific modules will be taught by our academic Schools and allow students to enhance their knowledge within these subjects as well as some of the specific skills needed to study these subjects to degree level.</p>
<p>GOYO students will have an adviser&nbsp;for signposting and guidance on where and when to seek help should issues arise.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, students who have met the academic requirements for their chosen degree will be able to progress onto the second year of an Honours degree.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Semester 1&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Academic English and Study Skills 1&nbsp;</strong>This module aims to develop students’ awareness of spoken and written academic discourse typical of disciplines in the Faculty of Arts and Divinity and the Faculty of Science. Students will analyse written and spoken texts for purpose, style, organisation and use of language, and will use them as sources of ideas and models for their essays and presentations. The module provides opportunities for students to practise communicating in relevant genres, to get feedback on their performance, to reflect on their progress, and to deepen their understanding of good academic practice.</li>
<li>Plus two modules from Optional - semester 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Semester 2&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Academic English and Study Skills 2&nbsp;</strong>This module follows on from Academic English and Study Skills 1 and aims to deepen students’ awareness of more sophisticated aspects of spoken and written academic discourse typical of disciplines in the Faculty of Arts and Divinity and the Faculty of Science. It aims to help students understand how these are based on underlying principles of developing knowledge and higher order thinking skills. The module provides opportunities for students to engage with texts and peers to develop these skills, to write analytical and evaluative texts, to receive comment and feedback on their performance, and to show development in language, knowledge and thinking skills. This module will support students’ study on other modules they take in the Faculty of Arts and Divinity or the Faculty of Science.</li>
<li>Plus two modules from Optional - semester 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pathway two</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semester 1
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicating in Academic Contexts 1 </strong>This module aims to develop students' awareness of spoken academic discourse. The module is aimed at students who already have a good general proficiency in English (CEFR B2), but who may not have been introduced to the style and conventions of academic spoken genres. In order to build proficiency, the module provides opportunity for students to practise communicating in these genres, to get feedback on their performance, and to reflect on their progress.</li>
<li><strong>Research and Writing for Science A&nbsp;</strong>This module helps students to understand the general principles of how to structure scientific texts, as well as introducing them to key features of general academic style and good academic practice. It offers opportunities to practise academic reading and writing in the scientific disciplines, and to receive and utilise feedback to develop writing skills.</li>
<li>Plus one module from Optional - semester 1</li>

<ul>
<li>Semester 2
<ul>
<li><strong>Communicating in Academic Contexts 2</strong>&nbsp;The module is aimed at students who already have a good general proficiency in English (High CEFR B2 moving to CEFR C1). It aims to support students to 1) develop a thorough understanding of Good Academic Practice (GAP) and how to apply this knowledge to their own work, 2) develop an understanding of basic processes involved in carrying out research, 3) communicate effectively through the academic presentation genre, and 4) further develop skills for listening in academic contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Research&nbsp;and Writing for Science B&nbsp;</strong>This module further develops the skills introduced in Research and Writing Skills for Science A in Semester 1. In particular, students will work on selecting appropriate sources and synthesising these into their written work in a meaningful manner. The module also encourages students to consider the purpose of their research and how this can be expressed most effectively through their writing.</li>
