                <p>The BD (Hons) in Divinity is a three-year course run by the School of Divinity. The course is only available to those who already hold an undergraduate degree and are now interested in focusing on theological and biblical studies. There is a four-year option for students who wish to also study biblical languages.</p>
<p>The course focuses on the teachings and practices of the Christian faith as rooted in biblical and theological studies, and considers the significance of faith today as well as the challenges to it. Students can expect to have the opportunity to engage with a number of specialist topics including, for example, the study of the biblical text in its original languages or the interactions of Christian theology with current scientific and philosophical developments.</p>
<p>During your first year, you will take modules covering both the Old and New Testaments, systematic theology, philosophy of religion, theological ethics, and the history of the early church.</p>
<p>Throughout all three years of your degree, you will take the required modules in divinity only. Find out more about <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skills you gain in detailed analytical study will prepare you for your second and third year, during which you will take reading-centred modules intended to bring you into close contact with the primary texts of Christian theology and biblical studies. These modules provide transition from the broader thematic study of subjects to a more detailed analysis of texts and traditions.</p>
<p>Final-year students must also complete a 10,000-word dissertation on a divinity topic chosen in consultation with teaching staff.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.</p>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Teaching in first year is mainly by lectures (10 to 100 students), supplemented by regular small-group tutorials (10 to 15 students).</p>
<p>At Honours level, greater emphasis is put on individual study and on students taking a major role in preparing for, and conducting, seminars (5 to 15 students) and classes (5 to 35 students).</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and workshops, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. &nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of divinity. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken tutor&nbsp;training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all divinity staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/people/">School of Divinity website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>

                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>All sub-honours modules are typically assessed by 50% coursework and 50% written examinations. At Honours level, at least 50% assessed work is coursework, with some modules including no exam element at all.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please&nbsp;see the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale</a>.</p>

                <h3>Careers</h3>
<p>Most graduates from the BD take the course as part of their preparation for ordination. That said, graduates from the theological and biblical disciplines develop key transferable skills in critical thinking and in written and oral communication, which make them highly attractive to potential employers. Accordingly, employment prospects are usually wide ranging.</p>
<p>Recent graduates from the School of Divinity have become:</p>
<ul>
<li>religious studies teachers</li>
<li>lay chaplains at schools</li>
<li>ordained ministers</li>
<li>journalists with the national and religious press.</li>
</ul>
<p>Others have gone on to become lawyers, corporate bankers, marketing managers, social workers, language therapists, and even wine tasters.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/careers/">Careers Centre</a>&nbsp;offers one-to-one advice to all students as well as a programme of events to assist students to build their employability skills.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of divinity may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6859/">St Mary’s College Society</a>. The society organises social events for the staff and students of the School of Divinity. The Society is very active with Friday lunches, pub evenings, the annual dinner, the annual ball and the Christmas lunch. They also have a charitable and spiritual role within the college, raising money for different charities throughout the year.</p>
<p>The School of Divinity is located in St Mary’s College, one of the oldest and most historic parts of the University, where theology has been taught for over 500 years. Today, teaching takes place in seminar rooms and lecture theatres equipped with the latest technology both within St Mary’s and around the University. The Divinity library is housed in the historic King James Library, and students have their own common room in the former Principal’s House.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
