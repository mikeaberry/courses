                <p>The MBiochem in Biochemistry is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern biochemist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first three years of your degree you will be introduced to core material relevant to all biology degree programmes such as animal and plant biology, molecular biology, cell biology and genetics. You will also begin to focus on advanced core material in your chosen area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside biology, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules that allow students to prepare for their Honours degree.</p>
<p>In your fourth year, students typically undertake a year-long research placement often away from St&nbsp;Andrews, in a research institute or in industry, along with an experimental design distance learning module.</p>
<p>The fifth and final year of the Masters degree involves highly specialised taught courses in your chosen specialty along with an extended laboratory research project.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission <a href="direct/index.html">directly into the second year of this course</a>.</p>
<p>Students can also take Biochemistry as a standard <a href="../biochemistry-bsc/index.html">four-year&nbsp;BSc degree</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
<p>These facilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>&nbsp;houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
<li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>&nbsp;has excellent facilities for behavioural, ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>&nbsp;offers large multi-group laboratories that are focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>The MBiochem in Biochemistry is taught through a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>workshops</li>
<li>practical classes</li>
<li>field work</li>
<li>research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a modern biochemist. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
<p>During fourth year, your project will be fully supervised at the host institute or company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and practical classes, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Biochemistry. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Biochemistry staff on the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/">School of Biology website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Biology, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
<p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fifth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others still include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
<p>During the external placement in fourth year, you will be assessed jointly by the immediate supervisor in your host institute or company and a member of staff in the School of Biology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements.

                <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Biochemistry may be interested in joining the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/biology/" target="_blank">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
<p>Biochemistry students have lectures and practicals in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the JF Allen Science Library.&nbsp;The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a>&nbsp;in the Bute building, houses a spectacular Zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
