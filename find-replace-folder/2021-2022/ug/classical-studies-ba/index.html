                <p>The BA (International Hons) in Classical Studies is a four-year course run jointly by the School of Classics at St&nbsp;Andrews and the Department of Classical Studies at the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/classicalstudies/">College of William &amp; Mary.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will study for two years at both St&nbsp;Andrews and William &amp; Mary, spending the first year of the programme at one institution and the second year at the other. You will then be able to choose where you wish to spend your third and fourth years of study and graduate from either university.</p>
<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>If you study a BA (International Honours) in Classical Studies, you will choose between two pathways: Greek and Latin, or Ancient History and Archaeology.</p>
<p>If you choose the Greek and Latin pathway, you will be able to take both Greek and Latin at complete beginners' level or at more advanced level if you have substantial previous experience.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you choose the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway, you will be introduced to, and given advanced training in, the history and material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The BA (International Honours)&nbsp;is a single Honours degree, and other combinations – such as joint Honours degrees – are not available with this programme. However, during the programme you will have opportunities to study a range of other subjects offered by both institutions.

                <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>This programme offers an impressive range of modules that students can take without losing the depth of focus by following either a language or ancient history and archaeology pathway.</p>
<p>Working together, the classics departments from both universities offer a unique range of modules. For example, students are able to pursue coursework in Etruscan archaeology and Egyptology (at William &amp; Mary) as well as modules in Late Antique and Bronze Age archaeology (at St&nbsp;Andrews): this unusual combination of modules is hard to find in any single department. The programme also provides Greek and Latin language students with a more flexible degree, one which can be tailored to your level of study between the two institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undertaking a classics degree in both campuses will also allow students a wider range of postgraduate opportunities in North America and the United Kingdom. As a student on the programme, you will have the unique advantage of knowing the UK and US systems well should you wish to make postgraduate applications.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Greeks in a Wider World:&nbsp;</strong>surveys Greek history from the origins of the Greek city-states in the Archaic period (ca. 800 BCE), through the heyday of Athens’ empire and democracy in the fifth century, to Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire. Alongside political and military history, the module tackles topics such as religious belief, slavery, and Greek interactions with other peoples of the ancient Mediterranean world.</li>
<li><strong>Rome and the Mediterranean</strong>: traces Rome’s trajectory from a small settlement in central Italy to the centre of a Mediterranean empire. The module examines a wide range of topics, including politics, the family, religion, slavery, poverty and the economy. It exposes the links between the growth of Rome’s power abroad and the transformation and eventual collapse of its Republican government at home and the rise of the first emperor, Augustus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on this pathway are strongly encouraged to take two modules of Latin or Greek alongside Ancient History in their first year.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Greek and Latin pathway</h4>
<p>Students on the Greek and Latin pathway who spend their first year at St Andrews must choose one of the following Latin or Greek module pathways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary Latin 1 and 2</strong>: provides an introduction to the Latin language for beginners, concentrating on morphology, vocabulary, and basic syntax.</li>
<li><strong>World of Latin 1 and 2&nbsp;</strong>(only available to students who have studied Latin to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): enhances understanding of Latin language and literature through study of both verse and prose set texts and regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>Greek Language for Beginners </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Greek Literature for Beginners</strong>: provides a thorough grounding in the Greek language for beginners or near beginners, and prepares students for the challenge of reading and interpreting Greek literature.</li>
<li><strong>Greek Language and Literature 1&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Greek Pastoral and Passion </strong>(only available to students who have studied Greek to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): involves detailed study of a range of set texts as well as linguistic and translation exercises designed to enhance students' knowledge of Greek and confidence in reading Greek literature in its historical and cultural context.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><h4>Ancient History and Archaeology pathway</h4>
<p>Students on the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway who spend their second year at St&nbsp;Andrews must choose two of the following compulsory modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Roman Empire</strong>: explores the complex history of the Roman Empire from Augustus to Late Antiquity, an empire which, for the first and last time, united the whole Mediterranean and its diverse hinterlands. The history and archaeology of the empire are studied through themes such as power, society, cultures, the army and the frontiers, cities, economies, and religions.</li>
<li><strong>Mediterranean Communities</strong>:&nbsp;examines the history and archaeology of human settlement in the Mediterranean world throughout the whole of classical antiquity.&nbsp;From around 1000 BCE to 500 CE, the Mediterranean was transformed from a world of tiny peasant and tribal communities to a world of complexly connected cities, states and empires. This module brings together themes of ecology, economy, urbanism, networks and the state to ask big questions about how and why classical civilisation emerged when and where it did.</li>
<li><strong>Early Greek Poetry and Philosophy</strong>: studies the earliest phases of the Greek literary and philosophical tradition in the archaic and early classical Greek world. It explores the diversity of early Greek thought through the poetry and philosophy of the period, and explores themes of conflict, justice, love and the relationship between mortals and gods.</li>
<li><strong>Culture and Thought in the Late Roman Republic</strong>:&nbsp;studies the art and literature of Rome in the Late Republic (first century BCE). Key literary texts, such as the passionate poetry of Catullus and the stylish rhetoric of Cicero, are set against the broader backdrop of Roman political, cultural and social life in this turbulent period of civil war and dictatorship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway are also strongly encouraged to take two modules in either Latin or Greek in their second year.</p>
<h4>Greek and Latin pathway</h4>
<p>Students on the Greek and Latin pathway who spend their second year at St Andrews continue their exploration of Greek and Latin language and literature by choosing one of the following Latin or Greek module pathways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latin in Progress 1 and 2</strong>: examines a wide range of texts in both prose and verse from the Republican and Imperial periods, and enhances Latin language skills through regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>Latin Language and Literature 1 and 2&nbsp;</strong>(only available to students who have studied Latin to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): builds on 'World of Latin 1 and 2'; examines a wide range of texts in both prose and verse from the Republican period and enhances Latin language skills through regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>The Landscape of Greek Prose (B) and Poetry (B)</strong>: examines a wide range of Greek prose texts and ancient poetry, and enhances Greek language skills through regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>The Landscape of Greek Prose (A) and Poetry (A)&nbsp;</strong>(only available to students who have studied Greek to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): examines a wide range of Greek prose texts and ancient poetry, and enhances Greek language skills through regular language classes.</li>

<li>practising language and translation skills</li>
<li>reading ancient source material in translation</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>At St&nbsp;Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Greek, Latin, ancient history and archaeology. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/people/">contact information for all&nbsp;classical studies staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of Classics website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Classical studies students may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/classics/" target="_blank">The&nbsp;Bacchae Society</a>&nbsp;is the student society for everyone with an interest in all things classical.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/studarchsoc/">The Student Archaeology Society</a>&nbsp;is a student-run society that organises regular meetings, talks, events and sometimes field-trips.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/University-of-St-Andrews-Archaeological-Society-842991512406806/">University of St&nbsp;Andrews Archaeology Society</a> is a forum for staff, students and townspeople with a general interest in archaeology to meet for evening lectures.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/history/" target="_blank">The History Society</a>&nbsp;hosts guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and main quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in this building, while lectures are held nearby in St Salvator’s quadrangle.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
