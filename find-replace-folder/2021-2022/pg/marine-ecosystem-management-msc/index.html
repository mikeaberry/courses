<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA (School of Physics and Astronomy): By having a very strong research-active University that competes with the best internationally, we can teach our postgraduate community how to evolve as researchers, how to work with our peer groups, in a way that wouldn't happen were we have to focus solely on teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ETHAN (PhD Philosophy, Illinois, USA): The research interests of the academic staff was the most important thing when deciding to come here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WEBSTER (PhD Divinity, Malawi): I find being in this place academically challenging, stimulating, and the community is captivating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIA (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, New York, USA): As a student, St Andrews is a world of its own. I just think it is the most brilliant and other-worldly place you could ever have.</p>
<p>- To be a student in St Andrews is the ultimate of student experience in higher education.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Professor JUDITH WOLFE (School of Divinity): St Andrews is a very special university because it is so small and intimate, and yet punches so far above its weight in terms of research, in terms of the calibre of students that we get, and in terms of community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; FIONA (PhD Medicine, Forres, Scotland): The postgraduate community in St Andrews is quite a close-knit one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HOI CHUN (MLitt Marketing, Hong Kong): Very warm and welcoming. Really easy to get to know them just because you are in a small town. You get that sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM (School of Computer Science): St Andrews is a research-intensive University. Most of the teaching staff are research active. So their interests feed into teaching.</p>
<p>- The research really is the life blood of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; NICOLE (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Minnesota, USA): The professors are always putting out new pieces of research. They really are pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIE BROOKS (School of Management): We're very lucky at St Andrews. We have really the best of the best applying, and it means we really get a very, very, high-quality student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR JAMES RAE (School of Earth and Environmental Sciences): We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR CHARLES WARREN (School of Geography and Sustainable Development): People who are willing to be challenged, and also to challenge, and people beyond their studies, people who are keen to contribute to the wider life of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; GABRIELLE (MSc Marine Mammal Science, Chia, Columbia): I've learned a lot of things, and I've made so many contacts.</p>
<p>- It's been the best experience of my entire life. I've loved every second of it.</p>
<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HANNAH (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, Nottingham, England): Life at St Andrews is wonderful. I think it's completely unique. There's so much to do. You cannot be bored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p>The MSc in Marine&nbsp;Ecosystem Management is a one-year&nbsp;taught programme run by the School of Biology. The programme takes a holistic approach to understanding ecosystem&nbsp;function and services, and draws on the quantitative and diverse academic expertise within the University's <a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Scottish Oceans Institute (SOI)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Modules include intense training in quantitative techniques (for example, statistical modelling and GIS).</li>
<li class="p1">Students have the exciting opportunity to conduct fieldwork and practical boat-based training,&nbsp;locally as part of&nbsp;a core module (included in course fee), and further afield as part of optional field courses (extra cost applicable) in Antarctica (polar ecology) or Indonesia (scientific diving).</li>
<li class="p1">Core modules in marine ecosystem function and management are complemented by a selection from optional modules including biologging, population biology, fisheries research, and estimating abundance.</li>
<li class="p1">Stimulating, small class sizes with a focus on student-led, experiential learning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The course consists of two taught semesters and an independent&nbsp;research project&nbsp;finishing in a written dissertation and poster presentation. The research project takes place during the entire year with particular focus during the last three months from June to August.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The modular curriculum is designed to be coherent, providing integrated training for future careers in scientific research, management or conservation. Teaching takes the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>debates</li>
<li>workshops</li>
<li>tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practicals involve lab work, field work, modelling and computer-based data analysis.</p>
<p>Class sizes usually range from 5 to 30 students, depending on the module. There is a strong focus on small-group teaching so that students are individually supported and can ask for help when it is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following module is compulsory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ecosystem-based Management of Marine Systems:</strong> introduces the concept of 'ecosystem-based management', exploring its development from more simplistic, single-species approaches.<strong><br></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Students choose <strong>three</strong> optional modules. Here is a sample of optional modules that may be offered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Issues in Biologging: </strong>presents an introduction to the theory and practice of logging and relaying physical and biological data using animal-attached tags.</li>
<li><strong>Estimating Animal Abundance and Biodiversity</strong>: introduces the main types of survey methods for wildlife populations.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Fisheries Research</strong>: provides an introduction to the utilisation of fish stocks in a sustainable way.</li>
<li><strong>Population Biology</strong>: covers the essentials of population dynamics and population modelling including population genetics, trophic interactions and spatial dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Predator Ecology in Polar Ecosystems:</strong>&nbsp;field course located in southern Argentina and Antarctica (requires payment of an expedition fee which covers all costs, including travel and accommodation). See the&nbsp;<span lang="EN"><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/antarctic/about/">students' Antarctic expedition blog</a></span>.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Diving:</strong> field course located in Indonesia (requires suitable diving qualifications and payment of expedition fee).</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on&nbsp;<a href="#53225">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p><span lang="EN">Throughout the academic year, students complete a research project which will&nbsp;culminate in a written dissertation and the presentation of a poster at the MSc student conference. Projects may involve some fieldwork but will be primarily focused on the analysis of existing data. Students can choose from a range of projects suggested by supervisors and also take an active role in designing their own project plan.</span></p>
<p>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MSc, there is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2021 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

		<p>"The Marine Ecosystem Management course really treats you like an early-career scientist in training. You grow so much, especially in your quantitative skills with R, GIS, and MATLAB after the first two semesters. On top of that, the course contextualises ecological concepts with real-life management happening in places like Scotland, the North Sea and Antarctica. The staff are open and friendly and there are lots of opportunities to learn by proxy from seminars and research groups."</p>
