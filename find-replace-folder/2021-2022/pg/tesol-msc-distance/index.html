		<p>[TEXT:] MSc TESOL via Distance Learning</p>
<p>[TEXT:] The University of St Andrews is consistently ranked among the Top 5 in the UK for student satisfaction and among the Top 100 universities worldwide. (National Student Survey 2019 and QS World University Ranking 2020)</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Students studying MSc TESOL via Distance Learning cover the same content as students on campus, and receive the same accreditation. This includes the choice of an optional specialism in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment and Evaluation</li>
<li>English for Academic Purposes</li>
<li>English Medium instruction</li>
<li>Teaching Young Learners</li>
<li>Technology for Teaching.</li>
</ul>
<p>[TEXT:] How did we optimise distance learning?</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Dr Lesley Thirkell, Deputy Director and Director of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Studies - International Education Institute, St Andrews</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: When we were planning the distance learning Masters programmes, there was various challenges to do with online learning that we had to consider. So first of all, the technology needs to be appealing but simple, because, for example, not all the students have access to the same quality of broadband that we are fortunate to have in St Andrews. And also, not all of the students are particularly skilled in technology, and that's not a requirement to study.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] No technological expertise required. Lessons are not delivered in real-time. Students learn via technology they already have, at the hours that best suit their routines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: So we've gone with the technology that's supported by the University, which is used by all our students in St Andrews and is generally pretty user friendly.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] How is the course structured to help distance learners?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: We made the modules, what we describe as short and fat, so the modules are all five weeks long, they are more intensive.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Short and intensive modules each lasting 5 weeks long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: Typically a module studied at the University of St Andrews is&nbsp;10 or&nbsp;11 weeks long. For a distance-learning student, in particular, keeping that momentum going over a&nbsp;10 or 11-week period can be quite challenging when life gets in the way.</p>
<p>So all our modules, be it studied on campus or by distance learning are five weeks long. So that means you've got this short burst of energy and enthusiasm, and then you've got a week's break until you start the next five-week block.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] This structure allows for greater flexibility, as distance learners do not need to commit to ten weeks of study at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] How will I access support from teachers and classmates?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: One of the most common challenges with studying by distance learning is that it's quite easy to feel a little bit isolated and lonely, and we were very keen to avoid that. So our on-campus students and our&nbsp;distance-learning students study the same module at the same time, and they have a shared online forum which both cohorts use with weekly tasks and chat rooms.</p>
<p>The intention is that the distance learning students then feel more of an integral part of what's going on in St Andrews.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] On-campus students and distance learners study the same module at the same time. Both have access to the same online forum. Distance learners are active participants in the programme at St Andrews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "Studying via distancing learning allows me to fit my education in around my work. I manage to do reading while travelling to work on public transport, and then listen to lectures and complete course work in the evenings when I have finished work." - Peter, Scotland: TESOL MSc</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "For a university-based career, a TESOL Master's Degree is probably essential." - Kerry Tavakoli, Second Language Acquisition, Young Learning and English Medium Instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Victoria Faken, librarian and Masters student at St Andrews, MSc TESOL via Distance Learning</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; VICTORIA: Comparing the St Andrews distance learning experience to the other experiences I've had, I've found it much more personalised. The support that you get from the institute is fantastic, and obviously, the academic side<br />of things is really excellent.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "I always consider myself incredibly privileged to be allowed to teach and get to know students on the TESOL programme. I love to follow their careers when they leave us." - Ally Malcolm-Smith, English for Academic Purposes</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; VICTORIA: They teach you as a person rather than just somebody on that course with a registration number. You're much more than just a statistic, I think, when you come to St Andrews, and I've been benefitted from having that experience.</p>
<p>The services are there. We've got things like online chat. We've got asking questions by email that are answered really quickly. We've got access to inter-library loans on a digital level as well as the print side of things. And we've got access to articles.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Remote access to academic resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chat to classmates and teaching staff.</li>
<li>Digital copies of library resources.</li>
<li>Article reach and inter-library loans.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>[TEXT:] Our MSc TESOL via Distance Learning programme equips graduates with the skills needed to succeed in the field of English language teaching, which offers job opportunities around the world at all levels of education.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Action Research for Teachers:&nbsp;</strong>provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>:&nbsp;explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the classroom. This is essential for all those seeking to understand their teaching environment more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Linguistics for Language Teachers</strong>:&nbsp;is designed to equip you with the skills required to describe and analyse written discourse. It does not assume prior knowledge of linguistics and seeks to introduce you to selected fundamental concepts, relevant to English language teaching. You acquire appropriate terminology and techniques in the analysis and description of grammatical terms and structures.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Second Language Acquisition</strong>:&nbsp;focuses on how subsequent languages are learnt after the first language by exploring the development of SLA theory. You will&nbsp;then consider how this theory informs teaching.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Teaching and Researching</strong>:&nbsp;helps you understand the features of a rigorous research question in the field of TESOL, as well as consider how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. The module also includes guidance and discussion on the different ethical considerations when conducting classroom-based research, as well as the important stages in writing up a dissertation.<br><br></li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>You will choose three optional modules from the following list,&nbsp;subject to timetabling restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>:&nbsp;provides students with a detailed understanding of the key concepts behind different methods of testing and evaluation in English language teaching and learning.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>:&nbsp;provides you with an understanding of the controversies&nbsp;of English as an international language for academic study, and the complexity involved in the use of English as a language of instruction from the standpoint of both the academic subject instructors and students who are using English as an L2. <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>:&nbsp;</strong>explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition,&nbsp;namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11 and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>:&nbsp;introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices&nbsp;of technology in language education. You are able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year, and some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University's position on <a href="index.html#d.en.85696">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>For the dissertation, you will choose a topic of interest to you and to your future career. You will read related literature and conduct independent research on your topic.</p>
<p>Student dissertations will be supervised by members of the teaching team. Supervisors will provide guidance throughout the research process, helping you to formulate a suitable research hypothesis and offering advice&nbsp;on relevant literature and how to plan your time effectively.</p>
<p>The completed dissertation of no more than 15,000 words must be submitted by a specified date in February or August each year, depending on the start date of your dissertation module.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose not to complete the dissertation required for the award of an MSc, there are exit awards available that allow suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for&nbsp;2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>
