<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA (School of Physics and Astronomy): By having a very strong research-active University that competes with the best internationally, we can teach our postgraduate community how to evolve as researchers, how to work with our peer groups, in a way that wouldn't happen were we have to focus solely on teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ETHAN (PhD Philosophy, Illinois, USA): The research interests of the academic staff was the most important thing when deciding to come here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WEBSTER (PhD Divinity, Malawi): I find being in this place academically challenging, stimulating, and the community is captivating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIA (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, New York, USA): As a student, St Andrews is a world of its own. I just think it is the most brilliant and other-worldly place you could ever have.</p>
<p>- To be a student in St Andrews is the ultimate of student experience in higher education.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Professor JUDITH WOLFE (School of Divinity): St Andrews is a very special university because it is so small and intimate, and yet punches so far above its weight in terms of research, in terms of the calibre of students that we get, and in terms of community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; FIONA (PhD Medicine, Forres, Scotland): The postgraduate community in St Andrews is quite a close-knit one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HOI CHUN (MLitt Marketing, Hong Kong): Very warm and welcoming. Really easy to get to know them just because you are in a small town. You get that sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM (School of Computer Science): St Andrews is a research-intensive University. Most of the teaching staff are research active. So their interests feed into teaching.</p>
<p>- The research really is the life blood of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; NICOLE (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Minnesota, USA): The professors are always putting out new pieces of research. They really are pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIE BROOKS (School of Management): We're very lucky at St Andrews. We have really the best of the best applying, and it means we really get a very, very, high-quality student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR JAMES RAE (School of Earth and Environmental Sciences): We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR CHARLES WARREN (School of Geography and Sustainable Development): People who are willing to be challenged, and also to challenge, and people beyond their studies, people who are keen to contribute to the wider life of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; GABRIELLE (MSc Marine Mammal Science, Chia, Columbia): I've learned a lot of things, and I've made so many contacts.</p>
<p>- It's been the best experience of my entire life. I've loved every second of it.</p>
<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p>What is gender and how does it influence our thinking about concepts such as equality, difference, and justice? On the MLitt in Gender Studies you will explore the theory and history of gender studies and its application to contemporary debates.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduces key topics in gender studies, providing a broad-based overview of the field.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary character helps you to develop a more rounded understanding of gender studies questions and concepts.</li>
<li>Prepares students for further academic study and research.</li>
<li>Links with the&nbsp;St Andrews Institute for Gender Studies bring you into contact with current gender studies research across different disciplines.</li>
<li>Integrated training programme connects your academic learning with the development of personal and professional competencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MLitt in Gender Studies is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and an emphasis on an intersectional understanding of gender. You will also benefit from links with the St Andrews Institute of Gender Studies.</p>
<p>Gender studies are inherently interdisciplinary. On this MLitt subject experts from across the University provide their own disciplinary perspectives on key topics. Your learning will encompass feminism and women’s studies, masculine studies, sexism and oppression, and queer theory. In this way you will engage with critical perspectives on gender and related subjects.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of gender studies questions and concepts and learn how to critically discuss gender from multiple disciplinary perspectives. You will also demonstrate your ability to solve complex problems by critical understanding, analysis, and synthesis.</p>
<p>The degree will be of particular interest if you intend to continue to doctoral research as it provides a broad-based programme of study culminating in a supervised research project.</p>
<p>The MLitt in Gender Studies is committed to the intersectional analysis of the phenomena it examines. You will explore the history and nature of key theoretical concepts in gender studies and the ways in which gender is defined, generated, and communicated in different academic and non-academic contexts. You will learn how to evaluate and construct arguments concerning the application of theoretical accounts of gender to contemporary questions and how to articulate controversies surrounding gender in the contemporary world. In doing so you will develop your understanding of how gender interacts with class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, inequality, and power.</p>
<p>The MLitt includes an integrated programme of skills workshops that connect your academic learning with the development of personal and professional competencies. Workshops bring together students from other Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies Masters degrees, helping you to make new interdisciplinary connections.</p>
<p>The MLitt in Gender Studies has close links with the <a href="http://staigs.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">St Andrews Institute for Gender Studies</a>. The Institute brings together more than 100 academic affiliates from 17 of the University’s schools and, as part of your studies, you will be encouraged to attend Institute events and to reflect on your learning from these. These links will bring you into contact with current gender studies research across different disciplines, helping to give your studies a remarkable richness and depth.</p>
<h3><strong>Teaching format</strong></h3>
<p>The taught modules are taken over two semesters – September to December (Semester 1) and January to May (Semester 2). The period from June to August is used to complete the end of degree project.</p>
<p>Each taught module will use teaching and learning methods appropriate to its aims. These may include seminars, workshops, lectures, tutorials, and independent study.</p>

You will learn how to critically examine current issues and controversies surrounding gender and deepen your understanding of the inextricable connections between gender, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, inequality, and power. Teamwork will play a key part in how the module will be run.</span></li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Optional modules allow you to broaden your learning in key topics relevant to the MLitt.</p>
<p>The available optional modules&nbsp;will be confirmed&nbsp;before the MLitt start date.</p>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on <a href="#53225">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The final part of the MLitt is the end of degree project. This takes the form of a period of supervised research where you will explore a gender studies topic in depth.</p>
<p>Through the project, you will show your ability to undertake sustained critical analysis, develop and improve your research skills, and produce an extended piece of written work that demonstrates a high level of understanding of your area of study.</p>
<p>You can choose to present your end of degree project in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>policy report that emphasises your ability to critically assess gender policy and make convincing recommendations for policy changes</li>
<li>multi-media portfolio that emphasises your ability to present gender studies concepts in exciting and engaging ways</li>
<li>written dissertation that emphasises your ability to plan and execute academically rigorous research.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MLitt, there&nbsp;is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will receive a PGDip instead of an MLitt.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2021 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/graduate-school/">Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies</a>&nbsp;was established in 2017 to foster interdisciplinary postgraduate education and scholarship.</p>
<p>The ability to work across subject boundaries is now recognised as an essential skill. The Graduate School’s Masters degrees will help you to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of your subject and to use ideas from different disciplines to illuminate your studies.</p>
<p>As well as their interdisciplinary character, the Graduate School's Masters degrees are distinguished by an emphasis on the development and application of practical skills. In addition to broadening your subject knowledge, you will develop your skills of critical thinking and creativity, analysis and appraisal, problem-solving and decision-making, and project management and personal leadership.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing aspects of joining the Graduate School is&nbsp;the&nbsp;welcoming interdisciplinary community. The Graduate School is a place where you can make social and intellectual connections across subject boundaries and where students form close networks within and across their Masters degree groups.</p>
