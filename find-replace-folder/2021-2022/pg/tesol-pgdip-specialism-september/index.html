		<p>[TEXT:] MSc TESOL at St Andrews</p>
<p>[TEXT:] The University of St Andrews is consistently ranked among the Top 5 in the UK for student satisfaction, and among the Top 100 universities worldwide. (National Student Survey 2019 and QS World University Ranking 2020)</p>
<p>[TEXT:] The MSc TESOL programme allows an optional specialism in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment and Evaluation</li>
<li>English for Academic Purposes</li>
<li>English Medium Instruction</li>
<li>Teaching Young Learners</li>
<li>Technology for Teaching</li>
</ul>
<p>[TEXT:] "I chose St Andrews as it allows you to study a TESOL as well as specialise in a specific area" - Julia, Germany: TESOL with a specialism in English for Academic Purposes MSc</p>
<p>[TEXT:] What will this course look like for me?</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Mr Eoin Jordan, Director of English Language Teaching - International Education Institute, St Andrews</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; EOIN JORDAN: Students studying with us in&nbsp;St&nbsp;Andrews will be taking two modules at any one time, and each of those modules offers five hours per week of contact time. So in addition to the 10 hours per week of modular contact time students have with their lecturers, they will also have the optional courses that we offer in terms of developing their professional and academic literacies.&nbsp;This is an optional course that we offer on a weekly basis to help them develop their academic skills but also professional profile over the course of the programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] The programme provides access to an optional course whose aim is to help students develop academic literacies as well as their professional profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] What employment opportunities will this course open me up to?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; EOIN: We've designed our Masters in TESOL programmes with our students' future careers in mind. The programme is designed to equip students with the skills and abilities that they need to succeed in a future TESOL-related career, whether that be teaching at university level right through to perhaps teaching young learners in a kindergarten setting.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] MSc TESOL equips graduates with the skills needed to succeed at any level of education; from university down to kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; EOIN: We focused on ensuring that all of our students are equipped with the ability to plan out single lessons but also programmes of study to share knowledge with peers and to benefit from the sharing of knowledge from peers, and also to understand the challenges and demands of taking on leadership roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Professional skills developed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planning lessons and programmes of study</li>
<li>Benefiting from the sharing of knowledge with peers</li>
<li>Understanding the challenges and demands of leadership opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt;&gt; EOIN: In&nbsp;addition to the content of our programme, we also pride ourselves on supporting students in their career search and ensuring that this is effective as possible for them.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] What support will be offered to me?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; EOIN: And that support begins when students arrive, and we start to encourage them to consider best choices for their dissertation research at the end of the programme to ensure that this is relevant to both their interests and their future career plans.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] From the very beginning, students are given guidance to help choose a dissertation topic that will be relevant to their interests and their future careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; EOIN: When students are actually actively looking for employment, we have a network of global contacts through the teaching experience and formal work experience of our staff and are well-positioned to direct students to relevant opportunities and also to help guide students in what they need to know when thinking about navigating application forms, developing a CV and taking interviews for positions.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] The teaching staff can draw on a wealth of industry experience, and can offer students help and advice. They are also able to provide support with application forms, developing a CV and taking interviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "The programme focuses on applying theory to practice, with students often being free to choose the teaching context they relate theory to in formative and summative assignments. In other words, the programme is designed to develop our students as TESOL professionals." - Janie Brooks, PG TESOL Programme Director</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "The International Education Institute is very resourceful and supportive, the staff are always willing to help you achieve your potential and are always able to listen to any questions or concerns you have." - Peter, Scotland: TESOL MSc</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Sam Ross, PhD Student and President of the Postgraduate Society, University of St Andrews</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; SAM: Hi, I'm Sam. I'm the Postgraduate Society President at the University of St Andrews, and I'm responsible for overseeing the Postgraduate Society Committee and the activities that we run.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] What will the postgraduate experience be like for me?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; SAM: Being a postgraduate in St Andrews is a really wonderful experience. My favourite thing about St Andrews has to be the proximity to the beaches. We've got three different beaches: West Sands, East Sands and Castle Sands. And it's a really nice place to go and just kind of have a walk and have a think about what sort of activities you've been doing and what you've been researching that day or what classes you've been in. I will never ever not appreciate the sunrises and sunsets in St Andrews.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Action Research for Teachers:&nbsp;</strong>provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>:&nbsp;explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the learning spaces. This is essential for all those seeking to understand teaching environments more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Linguistics for Language Teachers</strong>: equips you with the skills required to describe and analyse language. It does not assume prior knowledge of Linguistics and seeks to introduce you to selected fundamental concepts, relevant to English language teaching. You acquire appropriate terminology and techniques in the analysis and description of grammatical terms and structures.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Second Language Acquisition</strong>: how do we learn languages? Does it make any difference what age we start at? Why do some learners seem to do better than others? Answers to these questions, and many more would be very useful to inform language teachers, and to guide learners. This module traces the development of SLA theory, considers language learning from the perspective of learners, their differences and the strategies they can use, and from the perspective of the teacher and SLA researcher in order to apply theory to practice.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Teaching and Researching</strong>:&nbsp;teachers are increasingly expected to be evidence-informed or even evidence-led; consuming, creating, and sharing research. This module addresses how we evaluate the quality of research to decide what is rigorous and informative for our practice, how we can build on existing research when planning our own interventions, and how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. We consider a range of research contexts and values to help you actively engage with pedagogical research.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>You&nbsp;must take the specialism module related to your degree plus two&nbsp;optional&nbsp;modules from the following list, subject to timetabling restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>: brings together the study of language testing with the theory and practice of assessment in pedagogy. You will learn key concepts in both, how to design and improve tests for different purposes, and how to make productive use of assessment within teaching. We also consider some of the broader social impacts of assessment and testing and how teachers navigate tensions when promoting student learning within a measurement culture. The module also acts as an example of learning through assessment, giving you opportunities to reflect on how different approaches such as mastery learning or active learning are reflected in assessment design, as well as critiquing aspects of assessment such as the use of time limits, group tasks, multiple-choice questions, and gamification.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>: in recent years there has been a rapid increase in the teaching of academic subjects through English in countries where the majority of the population do not use English as a first language. This module explores this global trend from the standpoint of content and language teachers, as well as students. It considers the wide variety of English Medium Instruction contexts, evaluating theory in an attempt to address some of the practical challenges involved.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>: </strong></strong></strong>explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition,&nbsp;namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management. There is also a practical element to the module, as tutorials will involve the creation of materials and delivery to peers, who will take on the characteristics of the target students, in order to apply theory to practice.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>:&nbsp;introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices&nbsp;of technology in language education. You&nbsp;will be able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on <a href="index.html#d.en.85696">curriculum development</a>).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>Each module is only delivered once in each academic year.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2021 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

It is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation.</p>
<p>Assessment is increasingly becoming part of ELT pedagogy: mastery and active learning approaches&nbsp;use assessment tasks as learning tasks, low-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learning, and increasingly credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning. A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments. There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.</li>
<li>Take a specific 'Assessment and Evaluation' module and conduct research into the field of assessment and evaluation as part of the 'Action Research' module.</li>
