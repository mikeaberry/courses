		<p>[TEXT:] MSc TESOL via Distance Learning</p>
<p>[TEXT:] The University of St Andrews is consistently ranked among the Top 5 in the UK for student satisfaction and among the Top 100 universities worldwide. (National Student Survey 2019 and QS World University Ranking 2020)</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Students studying MSc TESOL via Distance Learning cover the same content as students on campus, and receive the same accreditation. This includes the choice of an optional specialism in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assessment and Evaluation</li>
<li>English for Academic Purposes</li>
<li>English Medium instruction</li>
<li>Teaching Young Learners</li>
<li>Technology for Teaching.</li>
</ul>
<p>[TEXT:] How did we optimise distance learning?</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Dr Lesley Thirkell, Deputy Director and Director of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Studies - International Education Institute, St Andrews</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: When we were planning the distance learning Masters programmes, there was various challenges to do with online learning that we had to consider. So first of all, the technology needs to be appealing but simple, because, for example, not all the students have access to the same quality of broadband that we are fortunate to have in St Andrews. And also, not all of the students are particularly skilled in technology, and that's not a requirement to study.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] No technological expertise required. Lessons are not delivered in real-time. Students learn via technology they already have, at the hours that best suit their routines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: So we've gone with the technology that's supported by the University, which is used by all our students in St Andrews and is generally pretty user friendly.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] How is the course structured to help distance learners?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: We made the modules, what we describe as short and fat, so the modules are all five weeks long, they are more intensive.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Short and intensive modules each lasting 5 weeks long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: Typically a module studied at the University of St Andrews is&nbsp;10 or&nbsp;11 weeks long. For a distance-learning student, in particular, keeping that momentum going over a&nbsp;10 or 11-week period can be quite challenging when life gets in the way.</p>
<p>So all our modules, be it studied on campus or by distance learning are five weeks long. So that means you've got this short burst of energy and enthusiasm, and then you've got a week's break until you start the next five-week block.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] This structure allows for greater flexibility, as distance learners do not need to commit to ten weeks of study at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] How will I access support from teachers and classmates?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; LESLEY: One of the most common challenges with studying by distance learning is that it's quite easy to feel a little bit isolated and lonely, and we were very keen to avoid that. So our on-campus students and our&nbsp;distance-learning students study the same module at the same time, and they have a shared online forum which both cohorts use with weekly tasks and chat rooms.</p>
<p>The intention is that the distance learning students then feel more of an integral part of what's going on in St Andrews.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] On-campus students and distance learners study the same module at the same time. Both have access to the same online forum. Distance learners are active participants in the programme at St Andrews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "Studying via distancing learning allows me to fit my education in around my work. I manage to do reading while travelling to work on public transport, and then listen to lectures and complete course work in the evenings when I have finished work." - Peter, Scotland: TESOL MSc</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "For a university-based career, a TESOL Master's Degree is probably essential." - Kerry Tavakoli, Second Language Acquisition, Young Learning and English Medium Instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Victoria Faken, librarian and Masters student at St Andrews, MSc TESOL via Distance Learning</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; VICTORIA: Comparing the St Andrews distance learning experience to the other experiences I've had, I've found it much more personalised. The support that you get from the institute is fantastic, and obviously, the academic side<br />of things is really excellent.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] "I always consider myself incredibly privileged to be allowed to teach and get to know students on the TESOL programme. I love to follow their careers when they leave us." - Ally Malcolm-Smith, English for Academic Purposes</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; VICTORIA: They teach you as a person rather than just somebody on that course with a registration number. You're much more than just a statistic, I think, when you come to St Andrews, and I've been benefitted from having that experience.</p>
<p>The services are there. We've got things like online chat. We've got asking questions by email that are answered really quickly. We've got access to inter-library loans on a digital level as well as the print side of things. And we've got access to articles.</p>
<p>[TEXT:] Remote access to academic resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chat to classmates and teaching staff.</li>
<li>Digital copies of library resources.</li>
<li>Article reach and inter-library loans.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>[TEXT:] Our MSc TESOL via Distance Learning programme equips graduates with the skills needed to succeed in the field of English language teaching, which offers job opportunities around the world at all levels of education.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Action Research for Teachers:&nbsp;</strong>provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>:&nbsp;explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the learning spaces. This is essential for all those seeking to understand teaching environments more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Linguistics for Language Teachers</strong>: equips you with the skills required to describe and analyse language. It does not assume prior knowledge of Linguistics and seeks to introduce you to selected fundamental concepts, relevant to English language teaching. You acquire appropriate terminology and techniques in the analysis and description of grammatical terms and structures.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Second Language Acquisition</strong>: how do we learn languages? Does it make any difference what age we start at? Why do some learners seem to do better than others? Answers to these questions, and many more would be very useful to inform language teachers, and to guide learners. This module traces the development of SLA theory, considers language learning from the perspective of learners, their differences and the strategies they can use, and from the perspective of the teacher and SLA researcher in order to apply theory to practice.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Teaching and Researching</strong>:&nbsp;teachers are increasingly expected to be evidence-informed or even evidence-led; consuming, creating, and sharing research. This module addresses how we evaluate the quality of research to decide what is rigorous and informative for our practice, how we can build on existing research when planning our own interventions, and how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. We consider a range of research contexts and values to help you actively engage with pedagogical research.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>You&nbsp;must take the specialism module related to your degree plus two&nbsp;optional&nbsp;modules from the following list, subject to timetabling restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>: brings together the study of language testing with the theory and practice of assessment in pedagogy. You will learn key concepts in both, how to design and improve tests for different purposes, and how to make productive use of assessment within teaching. We also consider some of the broader social impacts of assessment and testing and how teachers navigate tensions when promoting student learning within a measurement culture. The module also acts as an example of learning through assessment, giving you opportunities to reflect on how different approaches such as mastery learning or active learning are reflected in assessment design, as well as critiquing aspects of assessment such as the use of time limits, group tasks, multiple-choice questions, and gamification.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>: in recent years there has been a rapid increase in the teaching of academic subjects through English in countries where the majority of the population do not use English as a first language. This module explores this global trend from the standpoint of content and language teachers, as well as students. It considers the wide variety of English Medium Instruction contexts, evaluating theory in an attempt to address some of the practical challenges involved.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>: </strong></strong></strong>explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition,&nbsp;namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management. There is also a practical element to the module in order to apply theory to practice.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>:&nbsp;introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices&nbsp;of technology in language education. You&nbsp;will be able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on <a href="index.html#d.en.85696">curriculum development</a>).</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>Each module is only delivered once in each academic year.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for&nbsp;January 2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

It is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation.</p>
<p>Assessment is increasingly becoming part of ELT pedagogy: mastery and active learning approaches&nbsp;use assessment tasks as learning tasks, low-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learning, and increasingly credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning. A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments. There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.</li>
<li>Take a specific 'Assessment and Evaluation' module and conduct research into the field of assessment and evaluation as part of the 'Action Research' module.</li>
