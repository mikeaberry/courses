                <h2>Marine Biology BSc (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The BSc in Marine Biology will teach you about the diversity of marine life from the deep sea to estuaries. You will gain a deep understanding of the biology of marine organisms from tiny cells to large marine mammals. You will&nbsp;study at an advanced, research-led level and your topics will cover a broad range from marine molecular ecology, genomics, marine microbiology, the ecology and development of marine life from invertebrates to marine mammals, as well as the ecology of coasts and estuaries.</p>
                <p>St Andrews&rsquo; location on the shores of the North Sea makes it the ideal place to study marine wildlife in its natural habitat. Teaching takes advantage of this and you will have the opportunity to learn not only in the lab but also out in the field. The School of Biology has the world-renowned Scottish Oceans Institute, which incorporates the world-class Sea Mammal Research Unit which you can access in order to facilitate your study.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Students interested in this course may also be interested in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/marine-biology/marine-biology-mmarbiol/">Marine Biology Integrated Masters course</a>, which allows you to graduate with a Master in Marine Biology.</p>

            <p>The BSc in Marine Biology is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern marine biologist.</p>
            <p>In the first two years of your degree, you will take the core modules in Biology along with modules intended to prepare you for advanced modules in Marine Biology specifically. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules which allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, enquiry-based learning.</p>
            <p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
            <p>These facilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/research/#overview">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories that are focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">It is possible for students to take Marine Biology as a five-year Integrated Masters course, allowing you to graduate with a Master in Marine Biology.

                        <p>In fourth year, students undertake a substantial final year experimental or literature-based research project on a topic of their choice. The School provides significant support for the dissertation, with a breakdown of the assessment into different stages and a programme of seminars to assist in the development of advanced research and communication skills.</p>

                <p>The BSc in Marine Biology is taught through a combination of:&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>
                    <li>tutorials</li>
                    <li>practical classes</li>
                    <li>field work</li>
                    <li>research projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
                <p>Fourth year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies between a third and half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Field trips</h4>
                <p>From first year to Honours, students studying Marine Biology will also have the opportunity to go on field trips to gather data. Students in Marine Biology will be perfectly located in St Andrews on the shores of the east coast. In Honours years, students can explore further afield in places such as Indonesia and Antarctica.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
                <p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
                <p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on assessments, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Marine Biology students have lectures and practicals in the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/currentStudent/locations.aspx">Medical and Biological Sciences building at the North Haugh</a>. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building, houses a spectacular Zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.</p>
            <p>There&rsquo;s also the opportunity to join the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

                <p>"Over my time in the idyllic University of St Andrews I have had the wonderful opportunity to study a diverse range of topics within my own area of personal interest, marine biology, as well as branching out to the entire breadth of biology itself. As well as this, the opportunities to study outwith my subject, from laser physics to music theory have provided me with a fundamental academic base that will support me throughout the rest of my academic career as well as the rest of my life."</p>
