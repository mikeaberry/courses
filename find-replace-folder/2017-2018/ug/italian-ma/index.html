                <h2>Italian MA (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>As an MA (Hons) student of Italian, you will develop language and communications skills to a high level of proficiency. You will have the opportunity to engage with a number of specialist topics including Italian language, literature, culture, history, politics and film.</p>
                <p>Alongside learning the grammar and pronunciation of Italian, you will be introduced to a wide spectrum of texts and artistic genres, from mediaeval texts and poetry to 20th-century Italian novels, films and more.</p>
                <p>During your third year, you have the opportunity to study abroad in Italy at one of the University&rsquo;s Erasmus+ partners. Students who spend a year abroad not only gain valuable work experience as teachers and tutors, but also develop their linguistic skills, intercultural competence, and self-confidence. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>The MA in Italian is also available as a five-year course with an integrated year abroad. The integrated year abroad is an opportunity for students to spend a year working in a Italian-speaking country between second year and third year. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/italian/italian-ma/integrated-year-abroad/">Find out more about integrated year abroad options</a>.

            <h3 style="font-size: 32px;"><span>Course information</span></h3>
            <p dir="ltr">The MA (Hons) in Italian is a four-year course run by the School of Modern Languages. The course is available to both students who are beginners in Italian and to more advanced students who have studied Italian to A Level or SQA Higher.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">In the first two years, you will learn and refine Italian grammar and language through reading, writing, listening and speaking. Those with prior knowledge in Italian will further develop their language and writing, and both groups will be introduced to different aspects of Italian culture and history.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">During your third year, you have the opportunity to study at one of the University&rsquo;s Erasmus+ &nbsp;partner institutions in Italy. In this case, study undertaken in Italy replaces equivalent study in St Andrews. Studying abroad is optional.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">If you choose to stay in the UK for third and fourth year, you will take modules focused on communication skills and can choose to specialise in a number of areas. Areas of study include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Italian literature</li>
                <li>Italian film</li>
                <li>female Italian writers</li>
                <li>Italian poetry</li>
                <li>Italian history.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Graduates in Modern Languages from St Andrews can expect to have not only a high level of competency in language skills, but a highly developed appreciation for other cultures and peoples. Other transferable skills, including analysis, synthesis and communication skills will prepare you for a career in almost any industry.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">Students may choose to spend an additional year working or studying in Italy.

                <p dir="ltr">A work placement abroad fosters your capacity for effective teamwork in a new cultural environment, and among the personal attributes you will develop on the year abroad are self-confidence, independence, initiative and resourcefulness.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Recent Italian graduates have gone to work for companies in the UK and Italy. Some are working as teachers of modern languages in the UK, or are teaching English abroad. Others have taken further training or conversion courses to prepare for careers in translating and interpreting. Some examples of companies where Italian graduates have proceeded to work for include:</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Students of Italian may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://ahasoc.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">At Home and Abroad Society</a> (AHAsoc) promotes study and work abroad programmes along with all forms of international cultural exchange.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ItalianSoc/">Italian Society</a> promotes and shares the languages, arts, literature, theatre, cuisine, history and politics of Italy alongside frequent social events.</li>
            </ul>
            <p dir="ltr">The School of Modern Languages is situated at the very centre of St Andrews in the Buchanan Building on Union Street. Within the Buchanan Building is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/multi-mediacentre/">Multimedia Centre</a>, a digital language lab which students will use as both a component of their module classwork and as part of individual study.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

                <p>"I feel privileged to have been taught by staff who are not only experts in their field, but are also extremely approachable. This is something which I can't stress enough about the Italian Department. The curriculum is also enriching and varied. Whilst of course learning Italian is primarily about gaining language skills, here at St Andrews I have also learned a lot about Italian culture, politics, history and literature through studying the language."</p>
