            <p>The BSc in Zoology is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. The programme begins with a broad foundation across the range of biology, and then progresses from modules in molecular, cellular and organismal biology to a choice of options across a range of topics such as animal behaviour, development, evolution, neurobiology, environmental physiology, sea mammal biology, and various more ecological topics.</p>
            <p>The course incorporates substantial practical training, field work at sites around St Andrews and further afield, and development of quantitative skills. Students in their final year have the opportunity to engage with a number of specialist topics across the zoological research areas of the School of Biology, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ecosystems and conservation</li>
                <li>marine organisms</li>

            <p>These facilities include:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Field trips</h3>
            <p dir="ltr">From first year to Honours, students studying Biology will also have the opportunity to go on field trips to gather data. During third year, Zoology students may participate in a week-long field course involving field-based exercises in a range of aquatic or terrestrial habitats. Students will be able to examine and measure biodiversity, ecophysiological adaptation and community structure with both plant and animal materials.</p>

                <p>The BSc in Zoology is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>

                    <li>field work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a modern biologist. Each student is provided with teaching microscopes and is taught in state-of-the-art teaching laboratories. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies between a third and half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
                <p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
                <p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet, and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Zoology students may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a> organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/wildsocstandrews/">Wildlife and Conservation Society</a> is committed to promoting wildlife conservation among the student body through campaigns and events, including documentary film screenings, walks and festivals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Zoology students have lectures and practicals in purpose built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> One other area available for Biology students is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building, a spectacular zoology museum which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a></p>
