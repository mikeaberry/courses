                <h2>Chemistry MChem (Hons) <br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The MChem (Hons) in Chemistry will teach you the fundamentals of this central science, from the composition and properties of matter to using reactions to create new materials, from pharmaceuticals to drinkable water. Chemistry at St Andrews interfaces with biology, physics, mathematics, medicine and geology, making it a highly applicable subject to many areas of study.</p>
                <p>The MChem allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree. The course is designed to give you the best possible training for a career in chemistry and is tailored for those intending to enter the professional chemical sector or to carry out postgraduate study upon graduation.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Students can also take Chemistry as a standard four-year <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/chemistry/chemistry-bsc/">BSc degree</a>.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-info">Applications for 2017 entry for this course have now closed, <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">see which courses are available for the upcoming academic year</a>.</div>

                <p>In the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/quality/ref2014/">UK Research Excellence Framework 2014</a>, Chemistry research at St Andrews was ranked top in Scotland with 28% of its overall research activity rated as world leading.</p>
                <p>The School of Chemistry was the first School at St Andrews to receive an <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/hr/edi/sex_gender/athenaswansupport/chemistry/">Athena SWAN</a><a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/hr/edi/sex_gender/athenaswansupport/chemistry/"> Silver award</a>. The School is determined to actively support equality and fairness irrespective of race, disability, age, faith, gender and sexual orientation and is taking active steps to stamp out any explicit or implicit discrimination of staff and students on the basis of these differences.</p>
                <p>The University of St Andrews as a whole was voted top for student satisfaction in <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2016/title,624715,en.php">The National Student Survey 2016</a> as 94% of St Andrews final year students gave the University top marks for the quality of the learning and teaching experience.</p>

            <p>The MChem in Chemistry is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Chemistry. Chemistry at St Andrews provides students with a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of chemistry, along with intellectual training in numeracy, problem-solving, teamwork and communications.</p>
            <p>In the first two years, you will take modules in organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. The skills you gain in research and analysis during these years will prepare you to undertake more advanced and specialist modules during your final three years. These specialist subjects include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>organometallic chemistry</li>
                <li>carbohydrate and nucleic acid chemistry</li>
                <li>energy conversion and storage</li>
                <li>statistical mechanics and computational chemistry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In your fourth year, you will have the opportunity to apply for an external placement in a leading industrial laboratory in the UK, Europe and North America. The School of Chemistry will assist you in applying for a placement.</p>
            <p>During your final year, you will carry out a research project in one of the School&rsquo;s highly-rated research groups.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/chemistry/chemistry-mchem/direct/">direct entry to second year</a> for Chemistry MChem.</p>
                <p>Students can also take Chemistry as a standard four-year <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/chemistry/chemistry-bsc/">BSc degree</a>.</p>

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Chemistry alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take one or two Chemistry modules per semester during your first two years, and four to six per semester during your third, fourth, and fifth years (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system.</a>

                        <p>During fourth year, you will have the opportunity to work on a placement outside St Andrews for a whole year. This is a great chance to gain experience in industry and to add value to your CV at the same time.</p>
                        <p>Typically, you may join a research and development group within a company and receive a salary for the duration of your placement. It is also possible for the placement to be carried out in an overseas academic institution.</p>
                        <p>The School will assist students in applying for an 8 to 13-month placement in a leading industrial research laboratory. The School has links with large and small companies of different types, including:</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>The School of Chemistry is located in the Purdie Building and the Biomedical Sciences Building in the North Haugh on the western edge of town. These buildings offer recently upgraded lecture theatres and seminar rooms, as well as state-of-the-art teaching laboratories for chemistry.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

Lecturers are very friendly and always approachable, and the focus on practical chemistry during the whole degree greatly develops laboratory skills. The fact that it is an international School, in a student-driven town just adds to the overall experience.</span>"</p>
