                <h2>Materials Chemistry BSc (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p class="Normal1">The BSc (Hons) in Materials Chemistry seeks to understand the interrelationships between the composition, structure, microstructure and properties of solids in order to design and develop new materials &ndash; for example, semiconductor processing and fabrication; energy and IT; biomaterials; catalyst materials; &lsquo;smart coatings&rsquo;; and nanotechnology.</p>
                <p class="Normal1">During your degree, you will be provided with a broad base of chemical knowledge and understanding reinforced by extensive practical experience and familiarity with modern laboratory, instrumental and computational techniques. You will obtain the necessary skills and experience for a career in chemistry, whether in industry, education or research.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Students interested in this course may also be interested in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/chemistry/materials-chemistry-mchem/">Materials Chemistry Integrated Masters course</a>, which allows you to graduate with a Master of Chemistry.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="Normal1">The BSc in Materials Chemistry is a four-year course run by the School of Chemistry. During the course, you will develop awareness and appreciation of the latest advances in Materials Chemistry in addition to the fundamentals of the subject. You will be provided with a broad base of chemical knowledge and understanding reinforced by extensive practical experience. In addition, you will get a high level of general intellectual and scientific training, which allows many graduates to enter challenging careers in areas not directly related to chemistry.</p>
            <p class="Normal1">In the first two years, you will take modules in organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. The skills you gain in research and analysis during these years will prepare you to undertake more advanced and specialist modules during your final two years. These specialist subjects include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>advanced solid-state chemistry</li>
                <li>introduction to analysis of materials</li>
                <li>energy conversion and storage</li>
                <li>functional materials and electrons in solids</li>
                <li>statistical mechanics and computational chemistry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Normal1">During your final year, you will also carry out a research project on a topic chosen in consultation with staff from the School.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/chemistry/materials-chemistry-bsc/direct/">direct entry to second year</a> for Materials Chemistry.</p>
                <p>It is possible for students to take Materials Chemistry as a five-year Integrated Masters course, allowing you to graduate with a Master of Chemistry.

            <p>
                <p class="Normal1">In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Chemistry alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p class="Normal1">Typically, you will take one or two Chemistry modules per semester during your first two years, and four to six per semester during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p class="Normal1">The School of Chemistry is located in the Purdie Building and the Biomedical Sciences Building in the North Haugh on the western edge of town. These buildings offer recently upgraded lecture theatres and seminar rooms, as well as state-of-the-art teaching laboratories for chemistry.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
