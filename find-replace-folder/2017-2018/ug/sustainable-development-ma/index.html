                <h2>Sustainable Development MA (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>Sustainable Development is widely regarded as the most promising framework for addressing environmental and developmental challenges in the twenty-first century, including: the provision of clean water and adequate sanitation, energy generation and supply, human health, food production and distribution, and the continuing threat to biodiversity.</p>
                <p>The MA (Hons) in Sustainable Development encourages students to rise to the challenges of the environment and society, and focuses on the study of principles and practices of sustainability in an interdisciplinary environment.</p>
                <p>Sustainable Development is studied up to Honours level in both the Faculty of Science (BSc) and the Faculty of Arts (MA). Students who have a background in the arts or who wish to study Sustainable Development alongside arts subjects at St&nbsp;Andrews should apply for the MA. For those interested in studying Sustainable Development alongside science subjects, the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/sustainable-development/sustainable-development-bsc/">BSc in Sustainable Development</a></strong>&nbsp;may be of interest.</p><div class="alert alert-info">Applications for 2017 entry for this course have now closed, <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">see which courses are available for the upcoming academic year</a>.</div>

            <p>The MA (Hons) in Sustainable Development is a four-year course run by the School of Geography and Sustainable Development, with contributions from other Schools at the University.</p>
            <p class="Normal1">St Andrews also offers a <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/sustainable-development/sustainable-development-bsc/">BSc in Sustainable Development</a>, which may be more suitable for students who wish to take Sustainable Development alongside science subjects. The Sustainable Development element within both the BSc and MA degree programmes is exactly the same.</p>
            <p>Your first two years of study illustrate the breadth of issues involved in sustainable development as well as how to move from unsustainable to sustainable development.</p>
            <p>The knowledge you gain will prepare you for your final two years, during which you will have the opportunity to choose from a range of modules from different Schools. These modules allow you to pursue your specific interests and explore the practice of sustainability through specific field visits. Subjects in these modules include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>climate change</li>
                <li>environmental management</li>
                <li>sustainable technologies</li>
                <li>business and corporate responsibility</li>
                <li>social justice.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During your final year, you will also carry out a dissertation module which focuses on a topic of your choice, with structured support from a member of staff in an appropriate school.</p>

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take required modules in Sustainable Development alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take one Sustainable Development module per semester during your first two years, and four sustainability modules per semester during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Sustainable Development may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/STAUGeolsoc/">Geological Society</a>: organises academic activities such as lectures and networking events as well as social events and field trips to places such as Oban, Skye, and Loch Ness.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewsgeogsoc/">Geography Society</a>: organises regular social meetups and Geography-related events throughout the year for students and staff.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Geography and Sustainable Development is housed within the Irvine Building, an attractive building close to the sea in the historical heart of the University between St Salvator's Quadrangle and St Salvator's Hall. Students attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a></p>
