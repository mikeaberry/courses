                <p>The BSc (Hons) in Cell Biology involves advanced study of the molecular structures and biochemical processes essential to cell function. It provides the basis for understanding the physiology and development of animals and plants, as well as many aspects of pathology. The course includes modules that emphasise structure and function in the cells of animals, plants, and microbes, in addition to how cells interact as they form tissues and embryos.<div class="alert alert-info">Applications for 2017 entry for this course have now closed, <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">see which courses are available for the upcoming academic year</a>.</div>

            <p>The BSc in Cell Biology is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern cell biologist.</p>
            <p>In the first two years of your degree you will be introduced to core material relevant to all Biology degree programmes such as animal and plant biology, molecular biology, cell biology and genetics.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules which allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, inquiry-based learning as well as a final research project.</p>
            <p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These facilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology, cell biology and molecular medicine.</li>

                <p>Typically, you will take core Cell Biology modules during your first two years, and advanced modules during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

                        <p>In third year, you will have the opportunity to begin specialising in Cell Biology via the wide range of modules provided. Modules that have been offered in previous years include:</p>

                            <li>Protein Structure and Function</li>

                        <p>In fourth year, you will conduct a research project which is designed to develop your skills in experimental design and problem-solving, the evaluation and interpretation of data, and communications skills. The project is selected and supervised by a member of academic staff.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
                <p>The BSc in Cell Biology is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>
                    <li>tutorials</li>
                    <li>practical classes</li>
                    <li>field work</li>
                    <li>research projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a modern biologist. Each student is provided with teaching microscopes and are taught in state-of-the-art teaching laboratories. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
                <p>Fourth year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others still include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
                <p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on assessments, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Cell Biology may be interested in joining the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Cell Biology students have lectures and practicals in purpose built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building houses a spectacular zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show evolutionary relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
