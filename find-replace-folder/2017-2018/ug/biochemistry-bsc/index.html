                <h2>Biochemistry BSc (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The BSc (Hons) in Biochemistry entails the study of the biochemical mechanisms involved in all life processes covering a broad spectrum of fields, from viral replication to neurobiology. You will investigate the biochemical aspects of cell and organismal function and regulation including protein function, molecular genetics, membranes and cell communication, bioenergetics and pharmacology as well as final-year laboratory project with one of the relevant research groups in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">Biomedical Research Centre</a>.</p>
                <p>Students interested in this course may also be interested in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/biology/biochemistry-mbiochem/">Biochemistry Integrated Masters course</a>, which allows you to graduate with a Master in Biochemistry.</p>

            <p>The BSc in Biochemistry is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern biochemist.</p>
            <p>In the first two years of your degree, you will be introduced to core material relevant to all Biology degree programmes such as animal and plant biology, molecular biology, cell biology and genetics.</p>
            <p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules which allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, inquiry-based learning.</p>
            <p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
            <p>These facilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories are focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">It is possible for students to take Biochemistry as a five-year Integrated Masters course, allowing you to graduate with a Master in Biochemistry.

                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Biochemistry alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take core Biochemistry modules during your first two years, and advanced modules during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

                <p>The BSc in Biochemistry is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>
                    <li>tutorials</li>
                    <li>workshops</li>
                    <li>practical classes</li>
                    <li>field work</li>
                    <li>research projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a biochemist. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
                <p>Fourth year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies between a third and half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
                <p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others still include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
                <p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on assessments with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Biochemistry may be interested in joining the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Biochemistry students have lectures and practicals in purpose built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building houses a spectacular zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
