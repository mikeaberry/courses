                <h2>Middle East Studies MA (joint degree)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>Whilst St Andrews does not offer Middle East Studies as a single Honours degree, you can take Middle East Studies in combination with a wide variety of other subjects as part of a joint Honours degree. Middle East Studies provides training in the history of the Middle East, extending across 1500 years from modern Iran and Algeria back to the Ottoman and Safavid Empires.</p>
                <p>Taken with another subject, Middle East Studies offer a good opportunity for historical and comparative analysis between different literatures, cultures, history and politics.</p>

            <p>The Middle East Studies portion of the four-year joint Honours degree course is run by the School of History. The course teaches a wide range of disciplinary skills that are of great use in studying and understanding this culturally diverse and strategically important region of the world, one which is rarely out of the news at the present time.</p>
            <p>In the first two years of study, you will take modules in mediaeval and modern history which include elements of the Middle East, as well as a second year module dedicated to Middle Eastern history from late antiquity to the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979.</p>
            <p>In your third and fourth year, you will have the opportunity to take advanced modules which focus on specific regions and eras within Middle Eastern history.</p>
            <p>Graduates in History from St Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge in history, and be able to make connections across different time periods and between different cultures.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
                <p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (100 to 300 students) and small group tutorials (6 to 7 students). Lectures are given by all members of the School, enabling students to hear active researchers in each field talk about their specialism. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Teaching at Honours level moves away from large group lecturing. Students meet in groups of about 10 to 15 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>All sub-honours modules are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and examination. At Honours level, module assessment varies, with some modules being assessed solely by coursework.</p>
                <p>Coursework includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>research essays</li>
                    <li>oral presentations</li>
                    <li>class tests.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classroom examinations often incorporate essays and source exercises. In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Middle East Studies may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MESStAndrews/">Middle East Society</a> which hosts regular social events including dinners, themed nights, shisha evenings and film screenings.</p>
            <p>The School of History occupies three sites all within a few minutes&rsquo; walk of each other at the heart of the historic town of St Andrews. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in these buildings, while larger lectures are located in nearby buildings. The School of History sites are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>St Katharine&rsquo;s Lodge, a 19<sup>th</sup>-century former school near the seafront</li>
                <li>New Arts Building, a modern building with lecture classrooms and study spaces</li>
                <li>St John&rsquo;s House, located on South Street.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
