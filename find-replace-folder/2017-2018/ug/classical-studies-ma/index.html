            <p>The MA (Hons) in Classical Studies is a four-year course run by the School of Classics. The first two years focus on Greek and Roman literature, art and culture. In your first year, you will explore some of the most dynamic literary and artistic achievements of archaic and classical Greek and Roman culture.</p>
            <p>In second year you will take modules that further extend and refine your knowledge of Greek and Latin literature. This year covers the art and literature of the Late Roman Republic, and explores early Greek poetry and philosophy.</p>
            <p>There is no compulsory language element in the Classical Studies MA (Hons), although you can choose to study Latin or Greek through optional modules. The Classical Studies programme is extremely flexible and also allows you to take sub-honours modules from the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/ancient-history/ancient-history-ma/">Ancient History (MA) programme</a>, which will deepen and broaden your understanding of the historical background to Greek and Roman culture.</p>
            <p>The analytical skills you gain in your first two years will prepare you to continue exploring a wide range of texts and topics at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years (Honours level).</p>
            <p>At Honours level, you will be able to branch out and study modules across a range of genres which reflect your own particular interests. A wide selection of other historical, philosophical and cultural topics can also be studied. Topics include (but are not limited to):</p>

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Classical Studies alongside modules in at least one other subject. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>
                <p>The Classical Studies programme is very flexible and can incorporate modules in Ancient History, Latin and Greek alongside or even in place of specialist Classical Studies modules (though there are some minimum requirements), so that you can pursue your interests in the Greeks and Romans wherever they lead.</p>

                <p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (60 to 90 students) and small group tutorials (8 to 12 students). Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by an expert tutor.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.</p>
                <p>At Honours level, students are taught through seminars (10 to 20 students), with an emphasis on students&rsquo; own contribution in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Most modules in Classical Studies are assessed by a combination of 50% coursework and 50% examination. Coursework includes:</p>

                <p>Most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Classical Studies may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewshistorysociety/">History Society</a> hosts guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209948925/?fref=ts">The Greek and Cypriot Society</a> welcomes everyone with an interest in Greece, Greek history and culture.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/studarchsoc/">The Student Archaeological Society</a> promotes, supports and develops students&rsquo; interest in archaeology and archaeological activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and main quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in this building, while lectures are held nearby in St Salvator&rsquo;s quadrangle.</p>
            <p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics&rsquo; Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School&rsquo;s undergraduate programmes.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

                <p>"<span>As someone who threw themselves wholly into the School of Classics, taking only classical subjects from my first year onwards, I can honestly say that Classical Studies here is incredible. While the School is small, it works to our advantage, as the staff are extremely supportive outside classes and within them. The work is challenging, intersting and different and the courses are so diverse.</span>"</p>
