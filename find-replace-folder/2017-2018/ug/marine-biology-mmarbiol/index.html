                <p dir="ltr">Marine Biology involves study at an advanced, research-led level and covers marine molecular ecology, genomics, marine microbiology, the ecology and development of marine invertebrates and the ecology of coasts and estuaries.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">The MMarBiol allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree. The course is designed to enhance your research experience, preparing you for a career within the scientific sector.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">St Andrews&rsquo; location on the shores of the North Sea make it the ideal place to study marine wildlife in its natural habitat. The School of Biology has the world-renowned Scottish Oceans Institute, incorporating the Sea Mammal Research Unit, which students can access in order to facilitate study.</p>
                <p dir="ltr">Students can also take Marine Biology as a standard <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/marine-biology/marine-biology-bsc/">four-year BSc degree</a>.</p>

            <p dir="ltr">The MMarBiol in Marine Biology is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern marine biologist.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">In the first three years of your degree, you will take the core modules in Biology along with modules intended to prepare you for advanced modules in Marine Biology specifically. &nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">In your fourth year, students typically undertake a year-long research placement often away from St Andrews, in a research institute or in industry, along with an experimental design distance learning module.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The fifth and final year of the Masters degree involves highly specialised taught courses in your chosen specialty.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">These facilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants. &nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/research/#overview">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories that are focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Students can also take Marine Biology as a standard <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/marine-biology/marine-biology-bsc/">four-year BSc degree</a>.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Marine Biology students have lectures and practicals in the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/contact/">Medical and Biological Sciences building at the North Haugh</a>. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> The <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building, houses a spectacular Zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.</p>
            <p>There&rsquo;s also the opportunity to join the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
