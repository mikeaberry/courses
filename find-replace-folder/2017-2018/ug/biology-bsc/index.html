            <p>The BSc in Biology is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. Biology at St Andrews provides students with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern biologist.</p>
            <p>In the first two years of your degree you will be introduced to core material relevant to all Biology degree programmes such as animal and plant biology, molecular biology, cell biology and genetics.</p>
            <p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules which allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, enquiry-based learning.</p>
            <p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
            <p>These facilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants. &nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories are focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">It is possible for students to take Biology as a five-year Integrated Masters course, allowing you to graduate with a Master in Biology.

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Biology alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p align="left">Typically, you will take core Biology modules during your first two years, and advanced modules during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

                        <p>In third year, you will have the opportunity to begin specialising in Biology via the wide range of modules provided. The modules cover a variety of topics from animal plant interactions and zoology to pharmacology and neuroscience. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Here is a sample of Biology Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Protein Structure and Function</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In fourth year you will study your chosen subject area at a deeper scientific level and will also have the opportunity to select from an extremely wide range of small, group-specialised modules. These modules are taught by academics teaching to their research strengths and at the forefront of their discipline. A research project is also undertaken which occupies between a third and half of the year.</p>

                <p>The modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
                <p>The BSc in Biology is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>
                    <li>tutorials</li>
                    <li>practical classes</li>
                    <li>field work</li>
                    <li>research projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a modern biologist. Each student is provided with teaching microscopes and are taught in state of the art teaching laboratories. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
                <p>Fourth year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies between a third and half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Field trips</h4>
                <p>From first year to Honours, students studying Biology will also have the opportunity to go on field trips to gather data. Those who have a particular interest in ecology or marine biology will be perfectly located in St Andrews on the shores of the east coast. In Honours years, students can explore further afield in places such as Indonesia and Antarctica.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
                <p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others still include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
                <p>Group activities may also be assessed and in this case marking methods will be communicated to you in advance.</p>
                <p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on assessments, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Biology students have lectures and practicals in purpose built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> One other area available for biology students is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building, a spectacular zoology museum which includes the arrangement of species to show evolutionary relationships between animals.</p>
            <p>There&rsquo;s also the opportunity to join the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
