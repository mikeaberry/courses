                <h2>Biochemistry MBiochem (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The MBiochem (Hons) in Biochemistry entails the study of the biochemical mechanisms involved in all life processes covering a broad spectrum of fields, from viral replication to neurobiology. You will investigate the biochemical aspects of cell and organismal function and regulation, including: protein function, molecular genetics, membranes and cell communication, bioenergetics and pharmacology as well as a final-year laboratory project with one of the relevant research groups in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">Biomedical Research Centre</a>.</p>
                <p>The MBiochem allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree. The course is designed to enhance your research experience, preparing you for a career within the scientific sector.</p>
                <p>Students can also take Biochemistry as a standard four-year <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/biology/biochemistry-bsc/">BSc degree</a>.</p>

            <p>The MBiochem in Biochemistry is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern biochemist.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the first three years of your degree you will be introduced to core material relevant to all Biology degree programmes such as animal and plant biology, molecular biology, cell biology and genetics. You will also begin to focus on advanced core material in your chosen area.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In your fourth year, students typically undertake a year-long research placement often away from St Andrews, in a research institute or in industry, along with an experimental design distance learning module.</p>
            <p>The fifth and final year of the Masters degree involves highly specialised taught courses in your chosen specialty along with an extended laboratory research project.</p>
            <p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
            <p>These facilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>: houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
                <li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>: has excellent facilities for ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>: offers large multi-group laboratories that are focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>

                        <p>In fourth year, students typically undertake an independent 7 to 12-month research placement hosted by an external institute or company. The external placement gives students the opportunity to practice and learn a range of scientific and generic skills, including an element of independent working in a working environment outside of St Andrews.</p>
                        <p>Students will find out more about these placements once they have completed their first two years.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>In fifth year, you will also undertake an advanced laboratory research project to investigate a defined problem within biochemistry. The project will involve initiative and independence in experimental design and in pursuing the literature, excellent experimental and analytical techniques. Students will be allocated to a member of staff within the School of Biology who will guide and advise them in research activities throughout the academic year. The project will be presented in the form of a proposal, a research dissertation, an oral presentation and a viva.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Biochemistry may be interested in joining the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
            <p>Biochemistry students have lectures and practicals in purpose built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library.</a> The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute Building, houses a spectacular Zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
