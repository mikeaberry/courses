                <h2>Latin MA (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>Knowledge of Latin is not only essential to any in-depth understanding of ancient Roman culture, it is also the key to an enormously rich body of literature. The MA (Hons) in Latin will develop your Latin language skills. It will also develop skills of literary and cultural analysis which are important for understanding of complex texts, arguments and problems in our own culture too.</p>
                <p>The course will require you to engage in depth with a wide range of texts from classical antiquity. It involves study of the many different genres of ancient Latin literature from epic poetry and elegy to historiography and letter-writing. You will be required to develop skills of reading and understanding these texts in the original language. In the process you will also gain a broad understanding of ancient social, cultural and political history. <div class="alert alert-info">Applications for 2017 entry for this course have now closed, <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">see which courses are available for the upcoming academic year</a>.</div>

            <p>In the first year, if you have not studied Latin previously, you will be introduced to Latin language and literature from scratch. If you have already studied Latin at a higher level, during first year you will undertake more advanced study in language and literature in integrated modules working with literary texts and linguistic and translation exercises.</p>
            <p>In second year, all students take modules that extend and refine their knowledge of Latin literature and its background, covering prose and poetry both from the Republic and from the imperial period, while continuing to incorporate progressive work on Latin language skills in preparation for Honours-level study.</p>
            <p>The skills you gain in analysing original Latin texts will prepare you to explore an even wider range of texts at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to delve deeper into a specialist topic of your choice in writing a dissertation during your fourth year. All of the School&rsquo;s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes. Special subjects include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Latin prose writing, including philosophical writing, oratory, letter writing and biography</li>
                <li>Latin poetry, including didactic poetry, lyric, satire and epic</li>
                <li>Late antique Latin literature</li>
                <li>Latin prose composition</li>
                <li>Renaissance reception of Latin literature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is a wide choice of other modules available to complement Latin and suit your interests: popular choices include Ancient History and Archaeology, English Literature, Modern Languages, Medieval and Modern History, Philosophy and Divinity.</p>
            <p>Graduates in Latin from St Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge of Latin literature and culture and a high level of competency in Latin language.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Latin may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewshistorysociety/">History Society</a> hosts talks with guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6075/">Art History Society</a> promotes the enjoyment of art through criticism and study.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and St Salvator&rsquo;s quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building.</p>
            <p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics&rsquo; Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School&rsquo;s undergraduate programmes.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
