            <p>The MA (Hons) in Scottish History is a four-year course run by the School of History. During your studies, you will learn to approach Scottish History from a number of different angles, exploring issues such as invasions, rivalries, lordship, tyranny, Enlightenment, social problems and culture, past and present.</p>
            <p>In the first two years, you will have the opportunity to study from a broad chronological span, from antiquity to the present day. You will study how economic, social and political issues and events have fundamentally shaped modern Scottish society, and gain valuable insight into ongoing tensions within the Union and the nature of modern Scottish identity.</p>
            <p>The skills you gain in analysing original and secondary source materials will prepare you to dive deeper into specialist topics during your third and fourth years.</p>
            <p>Breadth of knowledge and perspective are highly encouraged, and all students are expected to take some modules in other subject areas, for example English, Art History or Geography.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Graduates in Scottish History from St Andrews can expect to have developed an appreciation for this country&rsquo;s history, and be able to make connections across different time periods and between different cultures.</p>

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Scottish History alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take one Scottish History module per semester during your first two years, and two modules per semester during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

                        <p>If you decide to take Scottish History in your third and fourth years, you choose from a wide variety of advanced options, including modules ranging from the Picts and Vikings to modern Scottish politics and society.</p>
                        <p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Some modules at Honours level are intended to build your portfolio and provide you with career experience. For example, the Recording the Past modules allow you to submit a multimedia historical project in the form of a radio programme, video documentary, website or other appropriate medium.</p>
                        <p>In fourth year, students also undertake a 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
                <p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (100 to 200 students) and small group tutorials (5 to 7 students). Lectures are given by all members of the School, enabling students to hear active researchers in each field talk about their specialism. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Teaching at Honours level moves away from large group lecturing. Students meet in groups of about 5 to 15 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>Almost all of the modules in Scottish History are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>research essays</li>
                    <li>class presentations</li>
                    <li>source analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classroom examinations often incorporate essays and source exercises. In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Scottish History may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~celtic/">Celtic Society</a> embraces all things Scottish and specialises in trips to the Highlands, pub socials, traditional Burns suppers, and ceilidhs.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/141712709206272/">Archaeological Society</a> is for those interested in anything from ancient weaponry to Indiana Jones. The society organises bi-weekly meetings (featuring guest speakers), social events, movie nights, and day trips to archaeological sites.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewshistorysociety/">History Society</a> hosts talks with guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of History occupies three sites all within a few minutes&rsquo; walk of each other at the heart of the historic town of St Andrews. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in these buildings, while larger lectures are located in nearby buildings. The School of History sites are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>St Katharine&rsquo;s Lodge, a 19th-century former school near the seafront</li>
                <li>New Arts Building, a modern building with lecture classrooms and study spaces</li>
                <li>St John&rsquo;s House, located on South Street.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

                <p>"<span>I was not intending to study Scottish History, but after one class I was captivated. Nothing can compare to the experience of studying in such a beautiful and ancient seaside town so steeped in the religious, political and educational history of this nation. Being taught by leading experts with such a passion for their subject&nbsp;&ndash; I don't think I could be happier studying anything else.</span>"</p>
