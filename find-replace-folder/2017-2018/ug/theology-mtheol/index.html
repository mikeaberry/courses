Through your optional choices, you also have the opportunity to specialise within Divinity by studying subjects like world religions, Greek, Hebrew, the anthropology of religion, the Dead Sea Scrolls, pastoral care or moral reasoning, or to pursue interdisciplinary interests by taking advantage of the variety of subjects offered through the Faculties of Arts or Science.</p><div class="alert alert-info">Applications for 2017 entry for this course have now closed, <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/">see which courses are available for the upcoming academic year</a>.</div>

            <p>The MTheol (Hons) in Theology is a four-year course run by the School of Divinity. The course focuses on the teachings and practices of the Christian faith as rooted in biblical and theological studies, and considers the significance of faith today as well as the challenges to it. Students can expect to have the opportunity to engage with a number of specialist topics including, for example, the study of the biblical text in its original languages or the interactions of Christian theology with current scientific and philosophical developments.</p>
            <p>During your first two years, you will take modules covering both the Old and New Testaments, systematic theology, theological ethics, and the history of the early church. You will also be able to choose optional modules which allow you to either consolidate your Divinity interests or to develop interdisciplinary ones. Students are encouraged to take New Testament Greek or Hebrew, but it is not required.</p>
            <p>The skills you gain in detailed analytical study will prepare you for your final two years, during which you will take reading-centred modules intended to bring you into close contact with the primary texts of Christian theology and biblical studies. These modules provide transition from the broader thematic study of subjects to a more detailed analysis of texts and traditions.</p>
            <p>Final year students must also complete a 10,000 to 12,000-word dissertation on a Theology topic chosen in consultation with teaching staff.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Theology alongside additional Divinity modules or modules offered by the Faculties of Art or Science.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take two Theology modules per semester during your first two years, and two to four modules during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Theology may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/admissions/ug/stm/stmsoc/">St Mary&rsquo;s College Society</a>. The society organises social events for the staff and students of the School of Divinity. The Society is very active with Friday lunches, pub evenings, the annual dinner, the annual ball and the Christmas lunch. They also have a charitable and spiritual role within the college, raising money for different charities throughout the year.</p>
            <p>The School of Divinity is located in St Mary&rsquo;s College, one of the oldest and most historic parts of the University, where theology has been taught for over 500 years. Today, teaching takes place in seminar rooms and lecture theatres equipped with the latest technology both within St Mary&rsquo;s and around the University. The Divinity library is housed in the historic King James Library, and students have their own common room in the former Principal&rsquo;s House.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a></p>
