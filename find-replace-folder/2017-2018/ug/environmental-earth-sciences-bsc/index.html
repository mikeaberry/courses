                <h2>Environmental Earth Sciences BSc (Hons) <br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>Environmental Earth Sciences focuses principally on understanding the processes that influence Earth&rsquo;s surface environments and how those are modified by both natural and anthropogenic processes. The programme addresses the main challenges facing society from climate change and the methods employed to better understand how the oceans, atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere are interconnected and drive environmental change.</p>
                <p>The degree utilises geology, chemistry, physics, and biology to understand Earth&rsquo;s surface environment both past and present. Applied training includes hands-on experience with cutting-edge techniques central to field- and lab-based studies in environmental and geobiological sciences.</p>
                <p>Students interested in this course may also be interested in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/earth-sciences-mgeol/">Earth Sciences MGeol degree</a>, which allows you to graduate with a Master of Geology.</p>

            <p>The BSc (Hons) in Environmental Earth Sciences is a four-year course run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. During your degree, you will be able to take advantage of hands-on field and laboratory-based research projects that investigate topics as varied as the isotopic signals preserved in ancient rocks to recent sediments and what they record about conditions at the time of their formation, to the impact of volcanoes on climate.</p>
            <p>In first year, you will be introduced to the main concepts of Geology, such as Earth structure and Earth history, including the origin of the planet and Earth&rsquo;s biosphere.</p>
            <p>In second year, modules provide additional and deeper study into mineralogy, sedimentary systems, palaeontology, geophysics and geochemistry.</p>
            <p>At Honours level, there is a shift from broad-themed modules to more specialised ones that introduce students to a wide variety of exciting new research trends and findings. Modules involve the opportunity to get first-hand experience of new research discoveries and advances in Geology by staff in an integrated lecture-lab-field forum. Advanced topics available at Honours level include (but are not limited to) the study of global biogeochemical cycles, geochronology, sedimentary systems and isotope geochemistry.</p>
            <p>The School is home to an array of state-of-the-art analytical facilities supported by full-time technicians. These allow for the detailed characterisation of natural and synthetic materials, culturing of micro and macro organisms in extreme environments, and geological and geophysical field deployment. These facilities enable addressing questions from fundamental field geology to assessing anthropological versus natural processes in driving climate change. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/research/">Find out more about research facilities</a>.</p>
            <p>As you advance in your degree, you are given more flexibility to choose your focus of study, whether that be in geochemistry or global biogeochemical cycles.&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>All students have the opportunity to obtain fieldwork skills via numerous day- to multi-week-long field trips associated with individual modules, as well as up to four weeks of fieldwork associated with their independent research projects.</p>
            <p>Examples of field trips that are part of the BSc Environmental Earth Sciences degree include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First year: the five-day &ldquo;Highland Fling&rdquo; to renowned geological sites in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
                <li>Second year: six days of geological field mapping training in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
                <li>Third year: six days in Rio Tinto investigating the geochemistry and geobiology of acid mine drainage in southern Spain.</li>
                <li>Fourth year: a five-day West Coast cruise exploring oceanography, marine biology, and sedimentology on a research vessel on Scotland&rsquo;s beautiful West Coast.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course.

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Environmental Earth Sciences alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take one to two Environmental Earth Sciences modules per semester during your first two years, and three to four during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

                <p>The School&rsquo;s teaching philosophy is to provide a thorough understanding of Earth Sciences through experiential learning via field- and lab-based study, first-hand experience in collecting data, testing hypotheses and undertaking analyses, and student-led investigative research.</p>
                <p>The BSc in Earth and Environmental Sciences is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>

                    <li>practical classes</li>
                    <li>field work</li>
                    <li>research projects.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each sub-honours module consists of four to five lectures (60 to 100 students) and one laboratory session per week, several single-day field excursions during each semester, and tutorial sessions (typically between four and six students).</p>
                <p>At Honours level, students attend lectures (25 to 35 students) and continue to develop core skills in Earth Sciences through optional modules and your own research project.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations including short questions and essays.</p>
                <p>At Honours level some modules are assessed through coursework (50%) and a final examination (50%), and other modules are based entirely on coursework.</p>
                <p>The Honours dissertation is assessed through a written dissertation, project proposal and presentation.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students in the School may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/STAUGeolsoc/">Geology Society</a>, which organises activities such as lectures and networking events as well as social events and field trips across Britain.</p>
            <p>The School of Earth and Environmental Sciences is housed within the Irvine Building in the historical heart of the University between St Salvator's Quadrangle and St Salvator's Hall. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building and in designated lecturer theatres elsewhere on campus.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
