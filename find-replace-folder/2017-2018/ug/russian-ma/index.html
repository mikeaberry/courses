                <p>All Modern Language modules involve a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical languages classes. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small language tutorials allow you to actively work together with your tutors to practice language skills, present papers, and discuss texts and issues relevant to the course.</p>
                <p>Sub-honours Russian modules are delivered through lectures (15 to 60 students), tutorials (10 to 15 students), language classes and oral classes.</p>
                <p>At Honours level, you will attend smaller language classes (5 to 15 students) and seminars (5 to 12 students).</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>All Russian modules are assessed by a combination of coursework (at least 40%) and end-of-semester examinations. Coursework includes advanced language exercises, discursive essays and oral presentations.</p>
                <p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand. Examinations are either entirely in written format or comprise both written and oral components.</p>
                <p>Tutors advise you closely on the preparation of written work and give individual assessments of your performance.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Russian may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/46755017056/">Russian Society</a> (RusSoc) is dedicated to sharing Russian culture and language in Fife. They host events including poetry nights, film screenings, coffee gatherings and international food evenings.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAsocStA/">University of St Andrews Ukrainian Society</a> (UASocStA) promotes Ukrainian culture in the University and the town. They host socials, cultural nights, cook-off and movie nights, and many other events.</li>
                <li><a href="http://ahasoc.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">At Home and Abroad Society</a> (AHAsoc) promotes study and work abroad programmes along with all forms of international cultural exchange.</li>
            </ul>
            <p dir="ltr">The School of Modern Languages is situated at the very centre of St Andrews in the Buchanan Building on Union Street. Within the Buchanan Building is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/multi-mediacentre/">Multimedia Centre</a>, a digital language lab which students will use as both a component of their module classwork and as part of individual study.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
