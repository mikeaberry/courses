                <h2>Ancient History MA (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The MA (Hons) in Ancient History explores the history of Greece and Rome, and neighbouring peoples such as the Persians and Carthaginians. Students study the period from the beginning of Greek writing and urbanism in eighth century BCE through to the collapse of the western Roman empire in the fifth century CE. Geographically the subject is centred on the Mediterranean world, but at times extends from the Persian Gulf to the Clyde and from the Crimea to the Sahara.</p>

            <p>The MA (Hons) in Ancient History is a four-year course run by the School of Classics. In the first year, no previous experience of ancient history or classical languages is required; any student is eligible to take Ancient History. The history of the ancient Greek world is traced from the eighth century BCE to Alexander the Great, and the history of Rome is studied from its beginnings to the Emperor Augustus. Modules introduce political, social and archaeological aspects of civilisations that contributed much to later European culture.</p>
            <p>In your second year you will undertake advanced study of the social, economic, administrative and religious history of the Roman Empire from Augustus to Constantine. You will also study the history of human settlement in the Mediterranean throughout classical antiquity. The rise and fall of classical civilisation is examined, with particular emphasis on archaeological evidence and the theories and interpretative models that modern historians have brought to bear on antiquity. These modules bridge the gap to Honours through focused assessment methods, including deeper analysis and practical tutorials using the University&rsquo;s archaeological collections.</p>
            <p>At Honours-level, you will be able to branch out and study a wide range of topics in Ancient History that cover key aspects of the social, economic, political and cultural history of the Greek and Roman world, from archaic Greece to the end of the Roman empire. All of the School&rsquo;s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes, such as slavery, religion, gender, warfare and imperialism.</p>

                        <p>In fourth year, students also undertake a 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p>

                <p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (80 to 100 students) and small group tutorials (8 to 12 students). Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by an expert tutor. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.</p>
                <p>At Honours level, all teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students&rsquo; own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>

                <p>Almost all of the modules in Ancient History are assessed by 50% coursework and 50% examination. However, some modules are assessed solely or mainly on coursework, and others include practical assessment. Coursework can include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>research essays</li>
                    <li>source analysis</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Ancient History may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/studarchsoc/">The Student Archaeological Society</a> promotes, supports and develops students&rsquo; interest in archaeology and archaeological activity.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209948925/?fref=ts">The Greek and Cypriot Society</a>&nbsp;welcomes everyone with an interest in Greece, Greek history and culture.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and St Salvator&rsquo;s quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, and individual meetings with tutors in this building, while lectures are usually held in St Salvator&rsquo;s.</p>
            <p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics&rsquo; Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School&rsquo;s undergraduate programmes.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

The expert tutors are open, friendly, and genuinely invest time in ensuring you achieve the best you possibly can. Students also have access to the incredibly well-stocked Classics Library, with breathtaking views over the North Sea; I can spend whole afternoons there lost in a good book.</span>"</p>
