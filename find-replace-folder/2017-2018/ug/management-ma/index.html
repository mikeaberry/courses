                <h2>Management MA (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The MA (Hons) in Management&nbsp;will introduce you to a variety of organisations in all sectors and teach you to understand various techniques which draw from the management discipline including marketing, organisational behaviour, managing in diverse and challenging situations, and analysing financial data. From your studies, you will acquire interpersonal skills in problem solving, critical thinking and self-reliance, and will be empowered to interrogate evidence, challenge logic, and question existing ways of doing things.</p>
                <p>You will learn from a team of international scholars whose teaching and research are based on the concept of responsible enterprise, which entails an ethical approach to managing organisations and their social and environmental impacts.</p>
                <p>The MA course is particularly suited for those wanting a range of options across arts subjects, but who want to give most of their attention to Management. For those interested in studying Management alongside science subjects, the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/management/management-bsc/">BSc in Management</a> may be of interest instead of the MA.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Students of Management may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MNGSociety">Management Society</a> organises an innovative programme of events offering valuable personal development and networking opportunities.</li>
                <li><a href="http://entrepreneurssociety.wixsite.com/entrepreneurs">Entrepreneur Society</a> promotes and nurtures entrepreneurship in the St Andrews community and beyond. The society hosts a wide variety of events including talks by fellow students who have started their own business alongside their studies.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.sta-investsoc.com/">Investment Society</a> is for students who wish to develop their passion for financial markets and investing. The society even runs a global equities portfolio as an educational tool. &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Management is located in the Gateway building on the western edge of St Andrews. The Gateway has state-of-the-art lecture and seminar facilities as well as an extensive private study area for students.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

                <p>"Fusing academic critical thought with transferable skills, the School has made the study of management an exciting prospect. When I started, I didn't know what I was getting into. I noticed that my degree was applicable to everyday life&nbsp;&ndash; we learned about how to communicate, how society is organised and how business fits into the bigger picture. The degree managed to teach a bit of everything, from sociology and psychology to finance and marketing. Moreover, what was taught felt relevant. The ability to choose from a wide range of modules allows you to create your own course and follow your own interest. My interest in the music industry prompted me to research a topic, and it was the most rewarding experience of my degree. I'm happy to have completed a degree that is critical of its own practices in a place that is open enough to allow students to think and develop new skills and strains of thought.&rdquo;</p>
