                <h2>Management Science BSc (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The BSc (Hons) in Management Science&nbsp;will introduce you to a variety of organisations in all sectors and teach you to understand various techniques which draw from the management discipline including marketing, organisational behaviour, managing in diverse and challenging situations, and analysing financial data. In addition, you will receive advanced training in quantitative techniques that are relevant to the analysis of managerial problems.</p>
                <p>In the School of Management, you will learn from a team of international scholars whose teaching and research are based on the concept of responsible enterprise, which entails an ethical approach to managing organisations and their social and environmental impacts.</p>
                <p>The Management Science BSc is particularly suited for those who want to give most of their attention to Management, as they acquire the skills to apply mathematics to Management.</p>

            <p>The BSc (Hons) in Management Science is a four-year course run by the School of Management.</p>
            <p>In the first two years, you will learn about organisations and how they operate in society as well as the core functions of managers within these organisations. You will also take modules in mathematics which will teach you the skills and techniques needed to apply mathematics to Management.</p>
            <p>During your third and fourth years, you will be able to explore a wide range of specialist subjects, which may include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>scenario thinking</li>
                <li>international banking</li>
                <li>consumer behaviour</li>
                <li>statistical modelling</li>
                <li>advanced data analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During your studies, you will obtain knowledge of international trends and develop interpersonal and transferable skills, as well as an orientation towards creativity and innovation.</p>

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Management and Mathematics alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take one to two Management and Mathematics modules per semester during your first two years, and three to four modules per semester during your third and fourth year (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.</p>

                <p>Modules in Management are delivered through lectures with class sizes around 200 to 300 students at sub-honours level and 20 to 170 students at Honours level.</p>
                <p>Lectures are often supplemented by small-group tutorials of around 15 students. These tutorials are structured around material that coordinates with lectures, and are small enough that tutors can give special attention to particular needs.</p>
                <p>Mathematics modules are taught through lectures (100 to 250 students) supplemented by practical laboratory classes (25 to 60 students) and small group tutorials (8 to 12 students).</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Management Science may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MNGSociety">Management Society</a> organises an innovative programme of events offering valuable personal development and networking opportunities.</li>
                <li><a href="http://entrepreneurssociety.wixsite.com/entrepreneurs">Entrepreneur Society</a> promotes and nurtures entrepreneurship in the St Andrews community and beyond. The society hosts a wide variety of events including talks by fellow students who have started their own business alongside their studies.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.sta-investsoc.com/">Investment Society</a> is for students who wish to develop their passion for financial markets and investing. The society even runs a global equities portfolio as an educational tool.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/StAndrews.SUMS/">Mathematics Society (SUMS)</a> is dedicated to bringing people together who are interested in maths. They hold regular socials and informative talks from guest speakers.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Management is located in the Gateway building on the western edge of St Andrews. The Gateway has state-of-the-art lecture and seminar facilities as well as an extensive private study area for students.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

I've also complemented my studies by taking an active role in many committees and societies which has given me skills in events and people management which are fundamental in real-world situations and have really helped with situational questions in job interviews.</span>"</p>
