                <h2>Classics MA (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>To study Classics in the original languages of Latin and Greek is to engage with a literature which shaped the intellectual life of western Europe over many centuries and which continues to influence western culture profoundly today. The MA (Hons) in Classics will develop your Latin and Greek language skills. It will also develop skills of literary and cultural analysis which are powerful tools for understanding complex texts, arguments and problems in our own culture too.</p>
                <p>The course will require you to engage in depth with a wide range of texts from classical antiquity. It involves study of the many different genres of ancient Greek and Latin literature from epic poetry and tragedy to historiography and philosophy. You will be required to develop skills of reading and understanding these texts in the original language. In the process you will also gain a broad understanding of ancient social, cultural and political history. During your time studying Classics at St Andrews there are opportunities also to study complementary subjects such as Ancient History and Archaeology.</p>

            <p>In the first year, if you have not studied Latin or Greek previously, you will be introduced to these languages from scratch. If you have already studied Latin or Greek at a higher level, during first year you will undertake more advanced study in language and literature in integrated modules working with literary texts and linguistic/translation exercises.</p>
            <p>In second year all students are brought together to take modules that extend and refine their knowledge of Latin and Greek literature and its background, covering both prose and poetry from the archaic period right through to late antiquity, while continuing to incorporate progressive work on Greek and Latin language skills in preparation for Honours-level study.</p>
            <p>The skills you gain in analysing original Greek and Latin texts will prepare you for exploring an even wider range of texts at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to delve deeper into a specialist topic of your choice in writing a dissertation during your fourth year. All of the School&rsquo;s honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes. Special subjects include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Greek poetry, including epic and tragedy</li>
                <li>Greek historiography, including authors like Herodotus and Thucydides</li>
                <li>Greek rhetoric</li>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Classics may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewshistorysociety/">History Society</a> hosts talks guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad. &nbsp;</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2209948925/?fref=ts">The Greek and Cypriot Society</a> welcomes everyone with an interest in Greece, Greek history and Greek culture.</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7240/">Bacchae Society</a> is the student society for everyone interested in all things classical.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and main quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building.</p>
            <p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics&rsquo; Class Library. The Class Library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School&rsquo;s undergraduate programmes. The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
