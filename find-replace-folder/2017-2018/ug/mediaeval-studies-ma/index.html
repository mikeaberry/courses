            <p>The MA (Hons) in Mediaeval Studies is a four-year interdisciplinary course run primarily by the School of History in collaboration with the Schools of English, Modern Languages and Art History.</p>
            <p>In the first two years, you will be introduced to the mediaeval world by studying the politics and societies of Britain, Europe, and the Middle East from around 500 to 1500 AD. You will gain a firm grounding in the major themes and developments of history as a scholarly discipline and will be able to critically examine primary sources. You will also have the flexibility to undertake modules focusing on mediaeval themes from English, Modern Languages and Art History, allowing for real breadth of study and perspective.</p>
            <p>In third and fourth year, you will be able to choose from a wide range of specialist studies on mediaeval society and culture. You will also be encouraged to dive deeper into a specialist topic of your choice during your fourth year.</p>
            <p>Graduates in Mediaeval Studies from St Andrews can expect to have developed a wide breadth of knowledge in history, culture and society, and to be able to collect and evaluate information as well as construct powerful arguments, both verbal and written.</p>

                        <p>If you decide to take Mediaeval Studies in your third and fourth years, you choose from a wide variety of advanced options, with topics ranging from Renaissance Venice to the European Reformation, and from witch hunts to revolutionary warfare.</p>
                        <p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mediaeval Philosophy</li>
                            <li>Luxury Goods in the Middle Ages</li>
                            <li>Manuscript Illumination in Western Europe</li>
                            <li>Old English Afterlives: Literary Anglo-Saxonism</li>
                            <li>Dante Alighieri</li>
                            <li>The Mediaeval Short Story</li>
                            <li>History of the Spanish Language</li>
                            <li>The Disintegration of the Roman Empire</li>
                            <li>The Iranian World from the Timurids to the Safavids (1370-1722).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some modules at Honours level are intended to build your portfolio and provide you with career experience. For example, the Recording the Past modules allow you to submit a multimedia historical project in the form of a radio programme, video documentary, website or other appropriate medium.</p>
                        <p>In fourth year, students also undertake a dissertation or Honours project on a topic of their choice with supervision from staff in the Schools of Art History, English, Modern Languages, or History. The dissertation is typically between 5,000 and 12,000 words in length depending on the topic. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p>

                <p>The modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
                <p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (100 to 200 students) and small group tutorials (5 to 7 students). Lectures are given by all members of the School, enabling students to hear active researchers in each field talk about their specialism. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Teaching at Honours level moves away from large group lecturing. Students meet in groups of about 5 to 15 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>Almost all of the modules in Mediaeval Studies are assessed by a combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>research essays</li>
                    <li>class presentations</li>
                    <li>book reviews</li>
                    <li>source analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classroom examinations often incorporate essays and source exercises. In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in the future.</p>

                <p>History students at St Andrews have traditionally moved into a very wide range of careers on graduating. Some continue their academic careers via a postgraduate training degree to doctoral study either in St Andrews or at another university. Other students have often progressed to postgraduate qualifications in teaching, law or accountancy.</p>
                <p>Recent Mediaeval Studies graduates have found careers as:</p>
                <ul>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of Mediaeval Studies may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/141712709206272/">Archaeological Society</a> is for those interested in anything from ancient weaponry to Indiana Jones. The society organises bi-weekly meetings (featuring guest speakers), social events, movie nights, and day trips to archaeological sites.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewshistorysociety/">History Society</a> hosts talks from guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of History occupies three sites all within a few minutes walk of each other at the heart of the historic town of St Andrews. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in these buildings, while larger lectures are located in nearby buildings. The School of History sites are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>St Katharine&rsquo;s Lodge, a 19th-century former school near the seafront</li>
                <li>New Arts Building, a modern building with lecture classrooms and study spaces</li>
                <li>St John&rsquo;s House, located on South Street.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
