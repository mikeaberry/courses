                <h2>Geology BSc (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The BSc in Geology at St Andrews will provide you with a deep understanding of the materials, structures, and processes that have characterised the solid earth throughout its 4.6 billion year history. The BSc Geology degree emphasises the origin and chemistry of rocks and minerals, geological mapping, and the processes and events that have shaped the rock record.</p>
                <p>Teaching provides training in the interaction of the sediments, minerals, and rocks with the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, integrating chemistry, physics, and biology to build a deep understanding of the Geosciences. Applied industrial training will introduce you to the skills and knowledge required by the oil and gas and mining industries, and research projects will allow you to undertake independent field mapping, supported by rock and mineral analysis.</p>
                <p>The BSc in Geology from St Andrews is accredited by the <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/">Geological Society of London</a>, which provides a faster track to gaining Chartered Geology status.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Students interested in this course may also be interested in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/earth-sciences-mgeol/">Earth Sciences Integrated Masters course</a>, which allows you to graduate with a Master of Geology.</p>

                    <p>Most students who enrol on this course have not studied Earth Sciences at school, and choose Earth Sciences based on a love of the environment, the outdoors, and science. If you are interested in the processes that shape the planet and its environment, a degree in Earth Sciences is likely the right choice.

            <h3 style="font-size: 32px;"><span>Course information</span></h3>
            <p>The BSc in Geology is a four-year course run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences and provides students with a combination of academic skills and vocational training. During your degree, you will be able to take advantage of hands-on field and laboratory-based research projects that investigate topics as varied as the origin of continental crust, to planetary origin and differentiation, to causes and consequences of Earth system functioning during pivotal periods of Earth history.</p>
            <p>In first year, you will be introduced to the main concepts of Geology, such as Earth structure and Earth history, including the origin of the planet and Earth&rsquo;s biosphere.</p>
            <p>In second year, modules provide additional and deeper study into mineralogy, sedimentary systems, palaeontology, geophysics and geochemistry.</p>
            <p>At Honours level, there is a shift from broad-themed modules to more specialised ones that introduce students to a wide variety of exciting new research trends and findings. Modules involve the opportunity to get first-hand experience of new research discoveries and advances in Geology by staff in an integrated lecture-lab-field forum.</p>
            <p>Advanced topics available at Honours level include (but are not limited to) GIS (g<span>eographic information systems)</span>&nbsp;for earth science, petroleum exploration and geophysics, and structural geology and tectonics.</p>
            <p>The School is home to an array of state-of-the-art analytical facilities supported by full-time technicians. These allow for the detailed characterisation of natural and synthetic materials, culturing of micro and macro organisms in extreme environments, and geological and geophysical field deployment. These facilities enable addressing questions from fundamental field geology to assessing anthropological versus natural processes in driving climate change. <a href="http://earthsci.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/facilities/">Find out more about research facilities</a>.</p>
            <h3>Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>Geology at St Andrews provides outstanding field-based training. Students&nbsp;have the opportunity to take numerous day-to multi-week-long field trips associated with individual modules, as well as up to four weeks of fieldwork associated with their independent research projects.</p>
            <p>Examples of field trips that are part of the BSc Environmental Earth Sciences degree include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First year: the five-day &ldquo;Highland Fling&rdquo; to renowned geological sites in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
                <li>Second year: six days of geological mapping in central Spain, examining multiple phases of continental collision and mountain building.</li>
                <li>Third year:&nbsp;twelve days of mapping the iconic Moine Thrust system and Caledonian igneous complexes in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
                <li>Fourth year: a two-week transect of the Alpine orogenic belt through northern Italy and central Switzerland.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/geology-bsc/direct/">direct entry to second year</a> for Geology.</p>
                <p>It is possible for students to take a five-year Integrated Masters course in Earth Sciences, allowing you to graduate with a Master of Geology.

                <p>The School&rsquo;s teaching philosophy is to provide a thorough understanding of Earth Sciences through experiential learning via field- and lab-based study, first-hand experience in collecting data, testing hypotheses and undertaking analyses, and student-led investigative research.</p>
                <p>The BSc in Geology is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>

                    <li>field work</li>
                    <li>research projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each sub-honours module consists of four to five lectures (60 to 100 students) and one laboratory session per week, several single-day field excursions during each semester, and tutorial sessions (typically between four and six students).&nbsp;</p>
                <p>At Honours level, students attend lectures (25 to 35 students) and continue to develop core skills in Geology through optional modules and by conducting your own research projects.</p>

                <p>At Honours level some modules are assessed through coursework (50%) and a final examination (50%), and other modules are based entirely on coursework.&nbsp;</p>

In addition, the BSc in Geology is accredited by the <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/">Geological Society of London</a>, which provides a faster track to chartered success</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students in the School may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/STAUGeolsoc/">Geological Society</a>, which organises activities such as lectures and networking events as well as social events and field trips across Britain.</p>
            <p>The School of Earth and Environmental Sciences is housed within the Irvine Building in the historical heart of the University between St Salvator's Quadrangle and St Salvator's Hall. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building and in designated lecturer theatres elsewhere on campus.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a></p>
