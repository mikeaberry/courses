            <p>The MA (Hons) in Spanish is a four-year course run by the School of Modern Languages. The course is available to both students who are beginners in Spanish and to more advanced students who have studied Spanish to A-Level or SQA Higher.</p>
            <p>In the first two years, students will take modules which complement their level of Spanish entering the degree. Students of all levels will develop a deeper understanding and control of Spanish and are offered a broad view of Spanish and Latin American literature, civilisation and culture.</p>
            <p>During your third year, you have the opportunity to study at one of the University&rsquo;s Erasmus+ partner institutions in a Spanish-speaking country or at the University of Montevideo (Uruguay). In this case, study undertaken at one of these institutions replaces equivalent study in St Andrews. Studying abroad is optional.</p>
            <p>In your fourth year you will take the final language modules to establish a sound knowledge of the Spanish language. Additional modules are focused on communication skills and in a number of areas such as Spanish and Latin American literature, linguistics, translation and history.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Graduates in Modern Languages from St Andrews can expect to have not only a high level of competency in language skills, but a highly developed appreciation for other cultures and peoples. Other transferable skills, including analysis, synthesis and communication skills will prepare you for a career in almost any industry.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">Students may choose to spend an additional year working or studying in a Spanish-speaking country.

                <p>All Modern Language modules involve a combination of lectures, tutorials and practical languages classes. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small language tutorials allow you to actively work together with your tutors to practice language skills, present papers, and discuss texts and issues relevant to the course.</p>
                <p>Sub-honours Spanish modules are delivered through lectures (50 to 100 students), seminars (12 to 15 students) and language classes (12 to 15 students).</p>
                <p>At Honours level, you will attend lectures and seminars (10 to 20 students) and language classes (12 to 15 students).</p>

                <p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand. Examinations are either entirely in written format or comprise both written and oral components.</p>

They recognise that a modern languages degree shows wide cultural experience as well as other personal transferable skills needed in employment.</p>
                <p>Graduates go into areas such as teaching, journalism, law, international business, publishing and media, the civil service and NGOs.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>The School of Modern Languages, in collaboration with The Byre Theatre, runs <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/research/conferences/byreworld/">Byre World</a>, an exciting programme of events related to the literature, film and cultures of the wider world.</p>
            <p>Students of Spanish may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://ahasoc.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">At Home and Abroad Society</a> (AHAsoc) promotes study and work abroad programmes along with all forms of international cultural exchange.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/StAndrewsHispanicSociety/">St Andrews Hispanic Society</a> is passionate about all things Spanish and Latin American including food, music, culture and more. The society holds weekly conversation practice, social dinners, sangr&iacute;a nights and lots more.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of Modern Languages is situated at the very centre of St Andrews in the Buchanan Building on Union Street. Within the Buchanan Building is the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modlangs/multi-mediacentre/">Multimedia Centre</a>, a digital language lab which students will use as both a component of their module classwork and as part of individual study.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a></p>

The Department is open, friendly and supportive, but also gives you the flexibility to focus on the areas of Spanish literature and history that interest you most. I had an incredible year abroad in Madrid and coming back to university could have been hard, but the Spanish Department kept lessons dynamic and interesting. "</p>
