                <p>The MA (Hons) in History will teach you to discover and analyse the full range of human activity over time. Through historical awareness, which enriches contemporary experience by linking the present with the past, you will be able to recognise the cultural and social values that have shaped cultures across the globe. From your studies, you will acquire intellectual skills in evaluating different kinds of evidence, and interpreting and communicating its significance to others.</p>
                <p>History is a flexible course which allows you to study all historical eras without chronological or geographical constraint. At St Andrews, you will be able to combine elements from ancient, mediaeval, modern, Scottish and Middle Eastern history.</p>

            <p>The MA (Hons) in History is a four-year course run by the School of History.&nbsp;In the first two years, you will have the opportunity to study from a broad chronological span, taking modules in at least two different historical periods.</p>
            <p>The skills you gain in analysing original and secondary source materials will prepare you to continue exploring a wide range historical subjects at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to dive deeper into a specialist topic of your choice during your fourth year.</p>
            <p>Breadth of knowledge and perspective are highly encouraged, and all students are expected to take some modules in other subject areas in their first two years, for example English, art history or anthropology.</p>
            <p>Graduates in History from St Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge in history, and be able to make connections across different time periods and between different cultures.</p>

                        <p>If you decide to take History in your third and fourth years, you choose modules from a wide variety of advanced options.</p>
                        <p>Here is a sample of Honours modules which have been offered in previous years:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Mediaeval Castle</li>
                            <li>Heretics and Social Outcasts in Western Europe</li>
                            <li>Age of Conquest: Edward I - Scotland and Wales (1239-1307)</li>
                            <li>The Formation of Islamic Iran: From the Arab Conquests to the Seljuq Empire (600-1200)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Some modules at Honours level are intended to build your portfolio and provide you with career experience. For example, the Recording the Past module allows you to submit a multimedia historical project in the form of a radio programme, video documentary, website or other appropriate medium.</p>
                        <p>In fourth year, students also undertake a 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p>

                <p>The modules listed here are the compulsory modules that students must take in order to graduate in this subject.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
                <p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered primarily through lectures (usually 100 to 300 students) and small group tutorials (6 to 7 students). Lectures are given by all members of the School, enabling students to hear active researchers in each field talk about their specialism. Tutorials are an opportunity for students to discuss and develop their thinking in a small and friendly atmosphere, guided by a professional expert.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Teaching at honours level moves away from large group lecturing. Students meet in groups of about 6 to 15 students for longer classes in which they are expected to participate fully.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In addition to lectures and tutorials, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
                <p>Almost all of the modules in History are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>research essays</li>
                    <li>class presentations</li>
                    <li>source analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classroom examinations often incorporate essays and source exercises. In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
                <p>The School provides feedback on every assessment, with a view to improving your performance in future.</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students of History may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/141712709206272/">Archaeological Society</a> is for those interested in anything from ancient weaponry to Indiana Jones. The society organises bi-weekly meetings (featuring guest speakers), social events, movie nights, and day trips to archaeological sites.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/standrewshistorysociety/">History Society</a> hosts talks with guest speakers on a variety of topics as well as social events including pub nights, garden parties and trips abroad.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The School of History occupies three sites all within a few minutes&rsquo; walk of each other at the heart of the historic town of St Andrews. Students will attend tutorials, seminars and individual meetings with tutors in these buildings, while larger lectures are located in nearby buildings. The School of History sites are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>St Katharine&rsquo;s Lodge, a 19th-century former school near the seafront</li>
                <li>New Arts Building, a modern building with lecture classrooms and study spaces</li>
                <li>St John&rsquo;s House, located on South Street.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>

                <p>"<span>Studying History at St Andrews has been fantastic. The range of modules on offer in first and second year gives you the best chance of finding out what you're really interested in and would like to pursue further. I also really appreciate the freedom afforded to students at Honours level to focus on their interests, and the consistently impressive teaching.</span>"</p>
