                <h2>Earth Sciences MGeol (Hons)<br>2017 entry</h2>
                <p>The MGeol in Earth Sciences will equip you with the skills and knowledge to investigate Earth as an interconnected system, integrating the study of the oceans, atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere, to understand the processes that have formed Earth and that generate environmental change. Applied training is provided via hands-on experience with analytical techniques and focussed field- and laboratory-based study.</p>
                <p>The MGeol allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree. The course is designed to enhance your research experience, preparing you for a career in industry or a PhD.</p>
                <p>The MGeol in Earth Sciences from St Andrews is accredited by the <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/">Geological Society of London</a>, which provides a faster track to gaining Chartered Geology status.</p>
                <p>Students can also take a standard four-year BSc degree in <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/environmental-earth-sciences-bsc/">Environmental Earth Sciences</a> or <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/geology-bsc/">Geology</a>.</p>

            <p>The MGeol (Hons) in Earth Sciences is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The MGeol degree is designed to give you advanced experience prior to undertaking full-time employment or PhD research.</p>
            <p>During your degree, you will be able to take advantage of hands-on field and laboratory-based research projects that investigate how Earth&rsquo;s surface became oxygenated, to planetary formation, to how the composition of the oceans and atmosphere have changed through time and their influence on the regulation of climate.</p>
            <p>As you advance in your degree, you are given more flexibility to choose your focus of study, whether that be in geological mapping, geochemistry, or global biogeochemical cycles.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">MGeol students have the chance to undertake a formal industrial placement with a company that would provide hands-on training as well as the option to take part in a self-organised and planned geological expedition during their degree. In both instances, these would be arranged in consultation with the course and module coordinators.</p>
            <h3>Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>All students have the opportunity to obtain fieldwork skills via numerous day- to multi-week-long field trips associated with individual modules, as well as up to four weeks of fieldwork associated with their independent research projects.</p>
            <p>Examples of the field trips that are part of the MGeol in Earth Sciences include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>five-day &ldquo;Highland Fling&rdquo; to renowned geological sites in the Scottish Highlands during first-year studies</li>
                <li>six days of geological mapping in central Spain examining the polyphase Hercynian and Alpine orogenic belts during second-year studies</li>
                <li>twelve days of mapping the iconic Moine Thrust system and Caledonian igneous complexes in the Scottish Highlands&nbsp;during third-year studies.</li>
                <li>a two-week transect of the Alpine orogenic belt through northern Italy and central Switzerland during fourth-year studies.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course.

                <p>Students can also take a standard four-year BSc degree in <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/environmental-earth-sciences-bsc/">Environmental Earth Sciences</a> or <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/earth-environmental-sciences/geology-bsc/">Geology</a>.</p>

            <p>
                <p>In the first two years of your degree (known as sub-honours) you will take the required modules in Earth Sciences alongside modules in at least one other subject.</p>
                <p>Typically, you will take one to two Earth Sciences modules per semester during your first two years, and three to four during your third, fourth and fifth years (known as Honours). <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">Find out more about the modular Scottish degree system</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The School&rsquo;s teaching philosophy is to provide a thorough understanding of Earth Sciences through experiential learning via field and lab-based study, first-hand experience in collecting data, testing hypotheses, undertaking analyses, and student-led investigative research.</p>
                <p>The MGeol in Earth Sciences is taught through a combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>lectures</li>
                    <li>seminars</li>

                    <li>research projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each sub-honours module consists of four to five lectures (60 to 100 students) and one laboratory session per week, several single-day field excursions during each semester, and tutorial sessions (typically between four and six students).</p>
                <p>At Honours level, students attend lectures (25 to 35 students) and continue to develop core skills in Earth Sciences through optional modules and their own research project.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>At Honours level some modules are assessed through coursework (50%) and a final examination (50%), and other modules are based entirely on coursework.</p>
                <p>The final-year dissertation is assessed through a written dissertation, project proposal and presentation.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Student life</h3>
            <p>From the outset, the University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
            <p>Students in the School may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/STAUGeolsoc/">Geology Society</a>, which organises activities such as lectures and networking events as well as social events and field trips across Britain.</p>
            <p>The School of Earth and Environmental Sciences is housed within the Irvine Building, an attractive building close to the sea in the historical heart of the University between St Salvator's Quadrangle and St Salvator's Hall. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building and in designated lecturer theatres elsewhere on campus.</p>
            <p>The town of St Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh make it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland. <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/">Find out more about student life at the University of St Andrews.</a>
