            <p>"This programme has been a truly enriching experience. It is both challenging and encouraging, filled with incredible staff and peers who pushed me to grow and develop as a student and human being. Coming from the US as a biblical studies student, I found the program refreshing and unique, but accessible for those without much background in theology."</p>

            <h2>Course information</h2>
            <p>The MLitt in Bible and the Contemporary World is a one-year taught programme run by the School of Divinity.</p>
            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain an understanding of how public issues and culture both shape and are shaped by Christian theology, biblical interpretation and practice.</li>
                <li>Combines campus-based and virtual learning modules.</li>
                <li>Join an international and interdenominational group of 20 to 25 students in relating the Christian traditions to a host of public issues.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Teaching format</h3>
            <p><span><span>Each semester begins with a residential study week held at St Mary's College, the School of Divinity. A typical residential study week, which is shared with the distance learning part-time students, includes lectures, seminars and other learning activities. Attendance is required at each study week from Monday through Wednesday, but students are encouraged to stay for the remainder of the week. You will need to pay for your own travel and accommodation costs to attend these mandatory study weeks.&nbsp;<br /></span></span>
            </p>
            <p>After the study week, students take one residential module and two Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) modules, which are shared with students on the part-time, distance learning version of this programme.</p>
            <p>Each VLE module comprises 15 weeks of study (typically divided into four units) and focuses on independent learning. In each unit of a module, students are supplied a number of scholarly articles and extracts from books which are supplemented by two written lectures available online in digital format; you will also have access to the library's extensive online subscriptions of journals and ebooks. In lieu of seminars, you will participate in online bulletin board discussions with your peers (not held in real time). Students will have one personal tutorial (usually via online video messaging or telephone) with a tutor per module.</p>
            <p>Assessment comprises four essays for each VLE module and a combination of essay and written examination for the campus-based module.</p>
            <p>The taught portion is followed by&nbsp;a 15,000-word dissertation written over three months during the summer and submitted mid-August. Students are assigned a supervisor who gives guidance on the topic and provides academic support during the research and writing phases.</p>

            <p>Residential study week in St Andrews, 22 to 26 January 2018.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/View?code=DI5924&amp;ugorpg=&amp;academic_year=2016%2F7&amp;return=Search?text=surveillance">Surveillance, Theology and the Bible</a>: thinking critically about surveillance in contemporary life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Students on this course will have the opportunity to take new modules in the academic year 2017-2018.&nbsp;There is no guarantee that these modules will run for 2017 entry. Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/" title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home &raquo; University &raquo; Administration A-Z &raquo; Course Catalogue &raquo; Postgraduate">module catalogue</a>.</span>
            </p>
            <h3>Dissertation</h3>
            <p><span>Students will begin research for the 15,000-word dissertation early in Semester 2, but will focus particularly on researching and writing from May through to submission in mid-August. Dissertations will be supervised by members of the teaching staff who will advise on the choice of subject and provide guidance throughout the research process. <br /></span>
            </p>
            <p><span>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MLitt, there is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MLitt.</span>
