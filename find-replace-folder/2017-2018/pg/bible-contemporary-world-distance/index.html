            <h3>Teaching format<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span> <br /></span></span></h3>
            <p><span><span>Each semester begins with a residential study week held at St Mary's College, the School of Divinity at the University of St Andrews. <span><span>A typical residential study week includes lectures, seminars, sessions on using the Moodle and MMS internet platforms and study skills training. It is also a good opportunity for you to meet your distance learning peers and tutors in person. </span></span>
                </span>
                </span>
            </p>
            <p><span><span>Attendance is required at each Study Week from Monday through Wednesday, but students are encouraged to stay for the remainder of the week. You will need to pay for your own travel and accommodation costs to attend these mandatory study weeks.&nbsp; </span></span>
            </p>
            <p>Both MLitt and PGDip students take three taught modules over the course of their programme. Each module comprises 15 weeks of study (typically divided into four units) and focuses on independent learning.</p>
            <p>In each unit of a module, students are supplied a number of scholarly articles and extracts from books which are supplemented by two written lectures available online in digital format; you will also have access to the library's extensive online subscriptions of journals and ebooks. In lieu of seminars, you will participate in online bulletin board discussions with your peers (not held in real time).</p>
            <p>Students typically write four essays for each module (one for each unit) and receive written feedback. Students will have one personal tutorial (usually via online video messaging or telephone) with a tutor per module where they can discuss their recent essay.</p>
            <p>The MLitt programme is followed by&nbsp;a 15,000-word dissertation submitted at the end of two years study. Students are assigned an individual supervisor for their dissertation, and meetings with supervisors are normally held via online video messaging or telephone.</p>

            <p>Admission to the University of St&nbsp;Andrews is governed by our&nbsp;Admissions policy.</p>
            <h4>Curriculum development</h4>
            <p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/course-revision-protocol.pdf" class="js-ga-track" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'download', 'click', 'Course revision protocol');">Our approach to course revision is described online.</a>

            <h4>Tuition fees</h4>
            <p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/fee-setting-protocol.pdf" class="js-ga-track" onClick="ga('send', 'event', 'download', 'click', 'Fee setting protocol');">The University’s approach to fee setting is described online.</a>
