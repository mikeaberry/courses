			<h2 class="heading-section__heading">Entry requirements</h2>

							<h3>Academic requirements</h3>
<p>See <a href="/subjects/study-options/foundation/who-can-apply/academic-requirements-pre-med/">typical academic requirements for the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme</a>. If your qualification is not shown, please email <a href="mailto:ifp@st-andrews.ac.uk">ifp@st-andrews.ac.uk</a> about the grades needed from your high school system.</p>
<p>You can demonstrate that you have met the academic requirements with a high school transcript from your final year at school. Any high school qualification you use as evidence of your academic ability should be from the last year you attended high school and dated within the previous three years.</p>
<p>You should apply before your final results are available, as the University can make you a conditional offer based on your past exam performance and predicted grades.</p>
<h3>English language requirement</h3>
<p>All International Foundation applicants must submit a Secure English Test (SELT) as evidence of their English language ability, unless they have a UK passport.</p>
<p>You will be required to submit a UKVI IELTS academic test score for progression onto BSc Medicine so you must take a UKVI IELTS academic test to meet English language entry requirements for the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme.</p>
<p>See a list of <a href="/subjects/entry/language-requirements/profiles/7-s/">approved English language tests and required scores</a> for this programme.</p>
<p>You do not need to have your result when you apply, as this can be a condition of an offer made by the University.</p>
<h3>Work experience requirement</h3>
<p>Students are required to have experience that allows them to demonstrate interpersonal skills relevant to the practice of medicine. This may include voluntary or work experience, and clinical observations. Applicants are advised to keep a record (for example, a diary) of this, as students will reflect upon these experiences throughout their International Foundation programme.</p>
<h3>University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT)</h3>
<p>Students who wish to move onto the degree in Medicine at St Andrews will require a competitive score in the UCAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Medicine requires students to take the test in the same year they start the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme. Entrants to the September 2023 programme must therefore take the test between July and September 2023.</p>
				        <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Do I need to have studied this subject before?</h3><p><p>Applicants must have studied sciences at school, and Chemistry should have been studied in the applicant&rsquo;s final year at school. If you studied Chemistry only to IGCSE level or Grade or Year 10, you may be eligible for the Medical Sciences (Extended International Pre-Med) programme.</p></p>
                <h3>Application requirements</h3>
<p>The University will ask you to provide the following documents as part of your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>your most recent high school transcript</li>
<li>a personal statement outlining why you wish to study medicine at St Andrews and reflecting on your life and learning experiences to explain why you feel you would be successful on this programme</li>
<li>an academic reference from your high school on their letterhead or from a school email</li>
<li>your official English language test result.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline for applications is Monday 31 July 2023. <strong>You only need to provide your high school transcript and personal statement when you first apply</strong> so that the University can consider your application. Your academic reference and your English language evidence can be provided later.</p>

<li>gain an accredited first-aid certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme enables international students to function effectively as undergraduates studying medicine, enhancing their discipline-specific knowledge and skills, and developing critical thinking and reflection.</p>
<p>By the end of the programme students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate an overall appreciation of the body of philosophies related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate knowledge that is embedded in the main theories, concepts and principles of the philosophies related to the study of medicine and apply that knowledge in practical contexts</li>
<li>undertake critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis of ideas, concepts, information and issues that are within the common understandings of health and medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate awareness of own and others&rsquo; roles, responsibilities and contributions when carrying out and evaluating tasks related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>convey complex information to a range of audiences such as fellow students, medical professionals, and patients</li>
<li>exercise autonomy and initiative in some activities in their learning</li>
<li>manage, under guidance, ethical and professional issues in accordance with current professional codes related to the medical profession.</li>
</ul>
                            	<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page.</a></p>

				<h3>Requirements for moving onto BSc Medicine (A100)</h3>
<p>To progress onto the <a href="/courses/2023-2024/ug/medicine-bsc-a100/">BSc Medicine (A100)</a> at St Andrews, students must pass all modules on the programme and achieve:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>an average grade of 11.0 or above at first sitting across the following modules:
<ul>
<li>Foundations for Medicine 1 (IE1101)</li>
<li>Foundations for Medicine 2 (IE1201)</li>
<li>Human Biology (IE1252)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a grade of 12.0 or above at first sitting in each of the following modules:
<ul>
<li>Biology 1 (BL1101)</li>
<li>Introductory Inorganic and Physical Chemistry (CH1401)</li>
<li>Organic and Biological Chemistry 1 (CH1601)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are graded on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/academicdatateam/assessmentandawards/gradingsheets/">University's 20-point scale</a>.</p>
<p>Students must also meet the following entry requirements of the School of Medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>a competitive score in UCAT, achieved in the year of entry onto the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme. If this condition is not met, the competitive score on UCAT can also be achieved in the year of graduation from the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme, prior to entry onto A100 BSc Medicine.</li>
<li>satisfactory performance on the multiple mini interviews with the School of Medicine</li>
<li>applicants who use English as an additional language and who cannot provide their English language ability through their school-leaving qualifications must achieve 7.0 in all four components of the International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) exam, to be taken at one sitting. This is irrespective of any other English qualification achieved. The final four consecutive years of secondary or high school education in an English-medium school may in some cases be considered as evidence of English language ability. This will be considered on a case by case basis. IELTS scores have a recommended two-year validity period, and this time limit will be applied.</li>
<li>fulfilment of the 'fitness to practise' criteria listed on the <a href="/courses/2023-2024/ug/medicine-bsc-a100/entry-requirements/">School of Medicine entry requirements web page</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<p>The programme director for the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme is required to comment on your fitness to practise Medicine at the end of your studies when you are considered for the BSc Medicine degree. Under the School of Medicine&rsquo;s policy, any concerns about your health or previous conduct or both may be considered at the time of application or prior to entry to the medical course. For more information, please refer to the <a href="/courses/2023-2024/ug/medicine-bsc-a100/entry-requirements/">entry requirements for BSc Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Students entering the Medical Sciences (International Pre-Med) programme in September 2023 will receive a conditional offer in Autumn 2023 for a place on the BSc Medicine (A100) starting in September 2024. Provided that you meet the above entry requirements for the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews, your offer to enter first year of the BSc Medicine (A100) will become unconditional.</p>
<h3>Studying a Science degree instead of BSc Medicine (A100)</h3>
<p>Students who do not move on to medicine but meet the academic requirements for the Faculty of Science, may be able to study a science degree at the University. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account both student performance, and capacity within the relevant subject area, and date of application. Students can also apply to secure a place at another institution. Programme directors will offer assistance in achieving the best possible outcome for you.</p>
<h3>Join a live question and answer session</h3>
<p>The International Education Institute offers <a href="/subjects/study-options/foundation/webinars/">question and answer sessions</a> (Q&amp;A) to prospective International Foundation students who would like more information about St Andrews, university life and the application process at the University.</p>
