				    	&ldquo;I was a bit apprehensive at the thought of going to university in a foreign country. My experience with the IFP programmes' wonderful teachers, staff and students, eased my concerns about living abroad. The most important thing I must commend the programme for is its ability to prepare students for the rigorous expectation of university life. I found the Business programme extremely helpful while preparing to take my first-year modules. I genuinely do not believe I would have similarly excelled academically if had opted to go straight into university.&rdquo;

							<h3>Academic requirements</h3>
<p>See <a href="/subjects/study-options/foundation/who-can-apply/academic-requirements-year-zero/">typical academic requirements for an International Year Zero programme</a>.

Any high school qualification you use as evidence of your academic ability should be from the last year you attended high school and dated within the previous three years.</p>
<p>You should apply before your final results are available, as the University can make you a conditional offer based on your past exam performance and predicted grades.</p>
<h3>English language requirement</h3>

<p>See a list of approved <a href="/subjects/entry/language-requirements/profiles/15-s/">English language tests and required scores</a> for this programme.</p>
<p>You do not need to have your result when you apply, as this can be a condition of an offer made by the University.</p>
				        <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Do I need to have studied this subject before?</h3><p><p><span>No, but candidates aiming at a degree in economics should have grades in mathematics or related subjects that demonstrate a secure grasp of numeracy.</span></p></p>
                <h3>Application requirements</h3>
<p>The University will ask you to provide the following documents as part of your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>your most recent high school transcript</li>
<li>a personal statement outlining why you wish to study Business - Management, Economics and Finance at St Andrews and reflecting on your life and learning experiences to explain why you feel you would be successful on this programme</li>
<li>an academic reference from your high school on their letterhead or from a school email</li>
<li>your official English language test result.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline for applications is Monday 31 July 2023. <strong>You only need to provide your high school transcript and personal statement when you first apply</strong> so that the University can consider your application. Your academic reference and your English language evidence can be provided later.</p>
