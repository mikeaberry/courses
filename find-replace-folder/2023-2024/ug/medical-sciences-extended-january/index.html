		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>This programme combines science and medicine to provide international students with a route onto the medicine degree at the University of St Andrews.</p>
<p>You will enjoy a friendly and supportive learning environment where you will study in small groups to accelerate your learning and adaption to the new culture. You will have access to a personal tutor to support you in your studies, help you to manage your time effectively and become an independent and reflective learner.</p>
<p>The course aims to ensure that students develop the analytical approach to learning and communication skills which are required to study medicine in a British university. The structure of the programme provides students with dedicated support in the first semester when it is most needed, but progressively enables students to work more independently and collaboratively as they will do on their medical degree programme.</p>
<p>You will learn to adapt to studying in a university environment and to develop a deeper knowledge of key sciences as well as general communication skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classes integrate science and English language learning through a focus on writing laboratory reports, structuring essays, critical thinking and scientific methods of investigation.</p>
<p>From the third semester, the programme will also introduce you to courses in medical ethics and clinical communication skills, as well as medical-related sciences.</p>
<p>By the end of the programme, students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate an overall appreciation of the body of knowledge of sciences and philosophies related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate knowledge that is embedded in the main theories, concepts and principles of the philosophies related to the study of medicine and apply that knowledge in practical contexts</li>
<li>undertake critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis of ideas, concepts, information and issues that are within the common understandings of sciences, health and medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate awareness of own and others&rsquo; roles, responsibilities and contributions when carrying out and evaluating tasks related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>convey complex information to a range of audiences such as fellow students, medical professionals, and patients</li>
<li>exercise autonomy and initiative in some activities in their learning</li>
<li>manage, under guidance, ethical and professional issues in accordance with current professional codes related to the medical profession.</li>

<h4>Clinical observation after Semester 1</h4>
<p>If possible, students are encouraged to undertake some clinical observation, usually in their home country. The key purpose is to enhance your understanding of the skills, qualities, practices and systems of care settings. The observation should take place in a care facility which you will organise in a location most convenient for you. It should only be undertaken if it is safe for you to do so. The International Education Institute at St Andrews can provide documentation to support your application to the care facility.</p></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In Semester 2, all students will study the same three compulsory modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biology 1:</strong> introduces students to molecular and cellular biology and covers cell diversity and the origins of life, cellular structures and fundamental processes.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Foundations for Medicine 1:</strong> focuses on academic research and writing skills along with seminar and project skills. You will study medical ethics in order and understand how this links to clinical practice and medical professionalism. You will also have sessions on effective communication and attend workshops with simulated and real patients in the School of Medicine.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Introductory Inorganic and Physical Chemistry:</strong> covers the origin of the elements, atoms and the Periodic Table, shapes and properties of molecules, chemistry of the elements, properties of solutions, thermochemistry, thermodynamics and kinetics.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In Semester 3, all students will study the same three compulsory modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundations for Medicine 2:</strong> builds on the skills studied in Semester 1 to enhance confidence and competence in communication, specifically for a degree in medicine. Students continue studying medical ethics. Students will also have a series of lectures on important themes in Medicine which are delivered by staff from the School of Medicine.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Human Biology:</strong> covers all the key physiological systems within the topic areas, with an overarching focus on how disease affects these systems.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Organic and Biological Chemistry 1:</strong> includes lectures on the structure, stereochemistry and nomenclature of simple organic compounds, fundamental organic reaction mechanisms, organic functional groups and their reactions, introductory bioorganic chemistry, and organic spectroscopy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs)</h4>
<p>To prepare for the MMIs held by the School of Medicine, there will be workshops on the various interview stations so that students can develop their interview skills and MMI performance. Students also study medical ethics in order to transition into first-year medicine with an understanding of how medical ethics link to clinical practice and medical professionalism. MMIs take place in Semester 3.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2023 entry.

<p>You will spend approximately 16 hours per week on focused learning activities. During this time, you will experience a mixture of lectures, seminars and tutorials.</p>
<p>Class sizes are likely to be between 14 and 16 students.</p>
<p>As well as your timetabled classes, you will be expected to complete approximately 20 to 25 hours of independent study each week. As a fully matriculated student, you have access to the University&rsquo;s libraries and study areas, but you will also work with the University's online learning tools (Moodle and Microsoft Teams).</p>
<p>Students are expected to do the following to prepare for classes and consolidate their learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>read and take notes from online or paper textbooks, articles, and other online sources as required</li>
<li>undertake additional research and self-study through the University library and online</li>
<li>complete a range of homework tasks, individually and in groups</li>
<li>engage with feedback on both formative and summative assessments.</li>
</ul>
