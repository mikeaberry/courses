<p>In my case I've had 20 years working in libraries, archives and museums and I really bring that into the teaching.</p>
<p>Other colleagues who do more research based work bring that to the teaching and we work together to make this course something for whatever path you're taking.</p>
<p>MATTHEW SHEARD &gt;&gt; One of the things that makes the course here at the University of St Andrews unique is that you're bringing together that cutting edge professional expertise within the Wardlow Museum and the Bell Pettigrew Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>Staff at those museums are thinking about what a museum can be and rethinking what a museum can be.</p>
<p>So we're carrying out experimentations and research to really understand what the best museum looks like.</p>
<p>DR BRUNO BRULON SOARES &gt;&gt; We are in a moment where museums are changing and heritage and the relations between society and cultural heritage are changing strongly in the present time so we really like to prepare our students to deal with these changes in very specific and critical topics such as sustainability to decolonisation and working with digital in different kinds of institutions.</p>
<p>EAGLETON &gt;&gt; St Andrews I think is a unique place to come.</p>
<p>It's a beautiful little spot on the coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>We've got an incredible academic team, really really strong practitioner team in the museums and we've worked hard to make those really integrate and intertwine to make this course a combination of theory and practice.</p>
<p>SHEARD &gt;&gt; Museum and Heritage Studies prepares you for the career in museums that you want.</p>
<p>You begin by looking across the broad range of everything that happens in a museum and then have the opportunity to specialise in the area that you are interested in.</p>
<p>You get to work alongside museum professionals who are currently doing the job themselves so they will often be teaching you in the afternoon what they themselves have been doing in the morning so you get that up-to-date knowledge from people who have the skill sets already.</p>
<p>NICOLE MEEHAN &gt;&gt; One of the benefits of being part of the Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies is that you'll be exposed to different types of learning from across a number of subjects and you'll also meet students who are working on radically different programmes from you.</p>
<p>You can share perspectives and you can learn from them.</p>
<p>EAGLETON &gt;&gt; This course is ideal for people who want to work in museums or who want to study them and go on to further research and maybe a PhD.</p>
<p>We really work with you from the beginning to see what your path is going to be and how we can best support you to be successful in it.</p>
<p>If you want more information about studying Museum and Heritage Studies at the University of St Andrews, have a look on our website, have a look for the museums on social media, have a look for the museums, galleries and collections institute online as well and get in touch, we'd be happy to talk to you.</p></p></div>

            <p>The MLitt in Museum and Heritage Studies is a taught postgraduate programme run by the Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Studies, in association with the School of Art History and the Museums of the University of St Andrews. The MLitt is aimed at students wanting to start a career in museum or gallery work, or for those looking for a mid-career change.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Highlights&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>The programme provides a grounding in both theoretical and practical elements of museum studies while offering the opportunity for specialism.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The degree provides broad training, covering all types of museums, galleries and heritage facilities, and includes the principles of conservation, museum education, exhibition planning and design, and management.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Teaching normally takes place in the University, while select structured visits to museums, art galleries, historic houses, ships and other heritage sites inform the programme learning experience.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Students may apply to undertake practical project work from a portfolio of options with a wide variety of host organisations. This includes the <a href="/museums/" target="null">Museums of the University of St Andrews</a>, who steward and share more than 115,000 objects across a wide range of subject areas, from art to zoology, and deliver exhibitions, programmes and digital engagement. Practical project work is indicative, the number of projects available to students for application will vary from year to year.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Students may also apply to take part in a summer exchange programme at our partner institution, the &Eacute;cole du Louvre.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

            <!-- Conferences and events --><section id='conferences' class='heading-section content-section section__anchor--sticky'><h2 class='heading-section__heading'>Events</h2><p>Like the University of St Andrews, its <a href="/museums/" target="null">museums</a> are rooted in and draw inspiration from this 600-year history of research and teaching, and the pursuit of knowledge for the common good.</p>
<p>The museums' collections are of national and international interest and importance and consist of around 115,000 artefacts and specimens. Museum collections are featured at the Wardlaw Museum and the Bell Pettigrew Museum, stored and studied in a dedicated Collections Centre, displayed across the University campus, and lent for exhibition nationally and internationally. </p>
<p>The temporary exhibitions programme is the lifeblood of the Museums, stimulating curiosity and starting conversations. Events are fun and usually free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mgci.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Museums, Galleries and Collections Institute (MGCI)</a> was established in 2005 and is a leading centre for consultancy, training and research in the heritage sector. It hosts an annual public lecture, usually given by an eminent museum director.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside of class visits, students are taken to the annual conference of the <a href="http://www.scottishmuseumsfederation.org.uk/">Scottish Museums Federation (SMF)</a>. One student every year is elected to sit on the SMF committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The School of Art History, where Museum and Heritage Studies academic staff find their home, supports a large, active and diverse postgraduate community. Postgraduate students publish the peer-reviewed <em>North Street Review</em> journal containing articles on a wide range of topics by students at St Andrews and other universities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School organises postgraduate research seminars and occasional symposia. Each year, they invite a number of artists and scholars to give lectures.&nbsp;</p></section>
