<p><strong>Action Research and Reflection for Education Practitioners</strong>: provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Education and Researching:</strong> teachers are increasingly expected to be evidence-informed or even evidence-led; consuming, creating, and sharing research. This module addresses how we evaluate the quality of research to decide what is rigorous and informative for our practice, how we can build on existing research when planning our own interventions, and how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. We consider a range of research contexts and values to help you actively engage with pedagogical research.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership and Management in International Education</strong>: asks students to think critically about the purpose, importance and understanding of key concepts and theories of educational leadership in higher education. To this end, the module will begin by exploring what is educational leadership and the qualities of an effective leader in educational settings in the 21st century. It will then introduce and consider relevant theories and principles underlying practice in educational leadership. In order to demonstrate an awareness of the contextual nature of leadership, the module will examine the contributions from international leadership perspectives in a number of different global contexts. Students will be encouraged to analyse and discuss questions and issues arising from the study in-line with their own practice and experience in both written and verbal communications.</p>
<p><strong>Organisational Development in International Education</strong>: you will learn about key theories of organisational development as well as their practical application to an educational setting. In addition, students will explore organisation diagnosis, leading change, and organisation culture. Students will be given the opportunity to reflect and critically apply the organisation development interventions to international settings.</p>
<p><strong>Trends and Policies in International Education</strong>: aims to raise awareness and enable reflection of the key trends and policies in international education. It provides students with the opportunity to examine the impact that these trends and policies have on standing pedagogical structures and the dialogues they create within the field of intercultural pedagogy. Against this backdrop, the module will encourage students to assess the impact that the decisions they make as leaders, or may go on to make as potential leaders within the field of international education have on the stakeholders within their context of work.</p>
<p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for September 2023 entry. Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div>

	                	<div class='tab-pane fade' id='tab-2' role='tabpanel'><p>Those on the MSc and PGDip programmes will choose three modules from the following list. If you are studying for the PGCert, you can choose any four modules from this list or from the compulsory module list.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>: brings together the study of language testing with the theory and practice of assessment in pedagogy. You will learn key concepts in both, how to design and improve tests for different purposes, and how to make productive use of assessment within teaching. We also consider some of the broader social impacts of assessment and testing and how teachers navigate tensions when promoting student learning within a measurement culture. The module also acts as an example of learning through assessment, giving you opportunities to reflect on how different approaches such as mastery learning or active learning are reflected in assessment design, as well as critiquing aspects of assessment such as the use of time limits, group tasks, multiple-choice questions, and gamification.</p>
<p><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>: In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the teaching of academic subjects through English in countries where the majority of the population do not use English as a first language. This module explores this global trend from the standpoint of content and language teachers, as well as students. It considers the wide variety of English medium instruction contexts, evaluating theory in the fields of teaching and learning, language acquisition and intercultural communication in an attempt to address some of the practical challenges involved.</p>
<p><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>: explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the learning spaces. This is essential for all those seeking to understand teaching environments more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Online Programme Design</strong>: you will learn about key theories of learning and teaching as well as the principles that underpin online programme design. In addition to this you will learn about digital content creation, how to build a sense of community in online teaching and learning contexts, and about assessment and evaluation in the online world. You will be given the opportunity to identify and conceptualise these aspects of online teaching and learning within your<br />own professional contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>: introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices of technology in language education. You will be able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.<br />Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students.</p>
<p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for September 2023 entry. Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div>
