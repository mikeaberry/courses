                <p>The Doctor of Professional Practice (DProf) in TESOL programme is designed for educational practitioners who wish to conduct practice-focused research within their professional context. This is a part-time, distance-learning programme at PhD level for experienced professionals who aspire to, or are already working in, leadership roles within educational organisations, or who wish to advance their classroom practice through research.</p>
<p>During your studies on the programme, you will develop research skills through taught modules, and by producing a portfolio of scholarly work such as journal articles, edited book chapters, and policy documents. This portfolio will contribute to the enhancement of practice within your educational community, while also developing your professional profile.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>A flexible distance-learning structure that allows you to engage in study alongside professional and personal commitments</li>
<li>The ability to complete doctoral research focused specifically on TESOL</li>
<li>A focus on practice-based research that benefits your professional context</li>
<li>The gradual development of a portfolio of scholarly work, which will enhance your professional profile during the programme</li>
<li>Support in applying for professional recognition, where appropriate (e.g. HEA/BALEAP fellowships)</li>
<li>The opportunity to engage with professional development opportunities within the International Education Institute and the wider University.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programme structure</h3>
<p>The DProf TESOL has two main components, making up a total of 540 credits for the programme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supplementary studies (120 credits; 60 of these may be awarded as Advanced Standing Credits for students who enter directly into year 2)</li>
<li>A portfolio that consists of professional projects (360 credits) and an integrative critical analysis (60 credits)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Supplementary studies</strong></p>
<p>You will take taught modules at Master&rsquo;s level over the initial 4 semesters of the programme (or 3 semesters, for students who enter into year 2). The modules are delivered in a variety of ways such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>recorded lectures&nbsp;</li>
<li>recorded mini-lectures&nbsp;</li>
<li>podcasts&nbsp;</li>
<li>online written forums with&nbsp;students&nbsp;resident in other parts of the world</li>
<li>intensive feedback sessions on your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these modules, you will integrate theory and practice by discussing and critiquing theoretical concepts and frameworks, and then applying them through a range of practical assessments. Assessments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a variety of different types of written assignments&nbsp;</li>
<li>presentations&nbsp;</li>
<li>development of teaching plans&nbsp;</li>
<li>material development</li>
<li>assessed online written forums.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Two of the compulsory modules you will take are only offered to DProf TESOL students, and are designed to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquire the skills you need to succeed as a doctoral practitioner</li>
<li>formulate a proposal for the &ldquo;professional projects&rdquo; component of the programme.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to submit a proposal for your professional projects work and undertake a progress review at the end of the supplementary studies component of the programme. Passing this progress review will allow you to move on to the professional projects component.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio (professional projects)</strong></p>
<p>This part of the portfolio will total 35,000-40,000 words, and will normally include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>3-4 journal articles/edited book chapters</li>
<li>a policy document/policy critique (e.g. school or national policies, or a current assessment paper) or 1-2 articles in practitioner journals.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least one of the journal articles submitted for assessment should be in a&nbsp;peer-reviewed international or national&nbsp;journal, and published before completion of the programme (&lsquo;online first&rsquo; is acceptable).&nbsp;A submission might, for example, include one conference paper, one book chapter, one journal paper, and a policy paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio (integrative critical analysis)</strong></p>
<p>This part of the portfolio will provide a reflective synthesis of all elements of the programme, and will explain the contribution you have made to professional practice in your chosen area. This part of the portfolio will total 12,500-15,000 words, and will normally include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the academic and intellectual context for your professional projects</li>
<li>A synthesis of your publications to demonstrate a coherent theme</li>
<li>Critical reflection on your professional development during the programme</li>
<li>Explanation of professional impact and contributions to knowledge resulting from your research.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment for the award of Doctor of Professional Practice (DProf)</strong></p>
<p>As with a PhD, your work will be evaluated for a doctoral award through a viva voce examination. If, following any revisions and/or resubmission after your viva, your work does not meet the requirements for the award of Doctor of Professional Practice, it will be considered for the award of either Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip).</p>

<p>If you are a year 2 entry student who has not completed an MSc TESOL qualification at the University of St Andrews, you will take all four modules from the following list.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Being a doctoral practitioner:</strong>&nbsp;provides you with an overview of expectations for students on the DProf programme, and for professional doctorates in general. Through the module, you will analyse the skills and foundational knowledge needed to complete your studies (e.g. methodologies for conducting classroom-based research; understandings of researcher-practitioner identity), and work towards developing a personal toolkit of skills and knowledge for success as a doctoral practitioner. You will also consider in detail key concepts relevant to the programme, such as reflective practice, explorative practice, and appreciative inquiry.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Planning for professional projects:</strong> provides support in planning out a full proposal for the professional projects component of your portfolio, as well as mapping out a timeline for successful completion of all aspects of the DProf programme. You will consider what the different outputs that make up your professional projects should be, and how these will form a thematically coherent body of research. You will also reflect on likely challenges you will face during the programme and how you will address these.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Action Research for Educational Practitioners:</strong>&nbsp;provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Education&nbsp;and Researching:</strong>&nbsp;teachers are increasingly expected to be evidence-informed or even evidence-led; consuming, creating, and sharing research. This module addresses how we evaluate the quality of research to decide what is rigorous and informative for our practice, how we can build on existing research when planning our own interventions, and how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. We consider a range of research contexts and values to help you actively engage with pedagogical research.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>If you are a year 1 entry student, you will take four modules from the following list (subject to timetabling constraints).</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you are a year 2 entry student who has completed an MSc TESOL qualification at the University of St Andrews, you will take the two modules from the following list that did not form part of your MSc TESOL studies.</p>
<p>If you are a year 2 entry student who has not completed an MSc TESOL qualification at University of St Andrews, you will not take any of the modules below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment and Evaluation in Education</strong>: brings together the study of language testing with the theory and practice of assessment in pedagogy. You will learn key concepts in both, how to design and improve tests for different purposes, and how to make productive use of assessment within teaching. We also consider some of the broader social impacts of assessment and testing and how teachers navigate tensions when promoting student learning within a measurement culture. The module also acts as an example of learning through assessment, giving you opportunities to reflect on how different approaches such as mastery learning or active learning are reflected in assessment design, as well as critiquing aspects of assessment such as the use of time limits, group tasks, multiple-choice questions, and gamification.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>: In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the teaching of academic subjects through English in countries where the majority of the population do not use English as a first language. This module explores this global trend from the standpoint of content and language teachers, as well as students. It considers the wide variety of English medium instruction contexts, evaluating theory in the fields of teaching and learning, language acquisition and intercultural communication in an attempt to address some of the practical challenges involved. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>:&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong>explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition, namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management. There is also a practical element to the module, in the form of tasks requiring you to create lesson plans and materials to share with your peers, to apply theory to practice. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>:&nbsp;introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices&nbsp;of technology in language education. You&nbsp;will be able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.</li>
