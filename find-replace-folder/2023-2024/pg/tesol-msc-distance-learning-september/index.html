	            <p>TESOL programmes are run by the International Education Institute.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flexible part-time study while working</li>
<li>Integrate theory and practice &ndash; discuss theoretical concepts and frameworks in small groups and in online written forums and apply these through practical assessments.</li>
<li>Interact with a global cohort of students, studying both in St Andrews and online around the world, through module learning activities.</li>
<li>Access an optional and supplementary resource bank of material in parallel with your PGT programme to support both your learning and the development of your professional identity.</li>
<li>Join experienced practitioners and scholars in the English language teaching community, with opportunities to be involved in ongoing professional development events and the annual <a href="/international-education/eap-conference/">English for Academic Purposes (EAP) conference</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of taught modules you will take depends on whether you are studying for the MSc, PGDip or PGCert degree. Those on the MSc and PGDip will take five compulsory modules plus three optional modules. If you decide to take TESOL with a specialism, you must take one of your optional modules in that specialism. Those on the PGCert will take four modules of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each module, you interact online in a weekly written discussion forum (or similar activity) with TESOL students in St Andrews and around the world, providing the opportunity to learn from peers living and working in a wide variety of contexts.</p>
<p>While the programme does not include a teaching placement or practicum, it supports students in exploring how theory can be applied to real-word situations, through:</p>
<ul>
<li>practical learning and assessment tasks</li>
<li>materials development activities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TESOL specialisms</h3>
<h4>Assessment and evaluation</h4>
<p>This specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation. It <span>opens up possibilities to work in a wide variety of academic settings, either writing assessment material or training those who write and deliver assessment and evaluation.</span></p>
<p>Assessment is increasingly becoming part of&nbsp;English language teaching (ELT) pedagogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>mastery and active learning approaches&nbsp;use assessment tasks as learning tasks</li>
<li>low-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learning</li>
<li>increasingly, credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments.</p>
<p>There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.</p>
<p>As part of this course, you will be able to experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.</p>
<h4>English for Academic Purposes (EAP)</h4>
<p>The EAP specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on teaching academic English. It opens up possibilities to work as an EAP tutor, course designer or assessment specialist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EAP is a growing discipline, and English is considered the lingua franca of academia. There is a strong need for evidence-based training and development in the practical teaching skills needed for this diverse and dynamic field.</p>
<p>You will develop knowledge and skills in academic discourses, materials design and assessment of EAP.</p>
<h4>English Medium Instruction (EMI)</h4>
<p>The EMI specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in English medium instruction. This is an aspect of education in English that is growing rapidly, offering various roles for English as a foreign language (EFL) and English for academic purposes (EAP) teachers. It opens <span>up possibilities to work in any level of education, covering EFL and EAP, as well as teacher development and management. It is also beneficial to educators in any subjects area who work, or plan to work, with students who are users of English as an additional language.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As a relatively new field of study, EMI can develop in many ways, giving opportunities for creativity and innovation, from primary to tertiary level study.</p>
<h4>Teaching Young Learners</h4>
<p>This specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in teaching young learners. It opens up<span> possibilities to work in a variety of preschool, elementary and secondary level educational settings as a teacher or policy specialist.</span></p>
<p>This degree aims to help you make connections between what you do on other modules in the context of teaching children or teenagers (from 4 to 18 years). Taking this specialism will provide you with a qualification that clearly highlights your knowledge and understanding of the needs and strengths of these age groups. This is advantageous as future employers can see immediately that you are more likely to be qualified for teaching in schools at any level.</p>
<p>You will be able produce a portfolio of four lessons for contexts which you can select yourself, giving room for creativity and a focus on your preferred age group.</p>
<h4>Technology for Teaching</h4>
<p>This specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on technology for teaching. Graduates with experience of technology for teaching are in demand in a wide variety of educational settings to enhance technology-led provision.</p>
<p>This specialism is aimed at students who want to develop the pedagogical knowledge that underpins the application of technology in language classrooms. This is a transdisciplinary course drawing on sources from a variety of fields like education, psychology, sociology, design, ludology, linguistics, and philosophy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will develop technical skills in a range of applications, such as data-driven learning, task-based learning, and game-based learning. You will also develop project management skills, using techniques from agile design and design thinking.</p>
                            	<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page.</a></p>

The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>: explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the learning spaces. This is essential for all those seeking to understand teaching environments more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.</p>
<p><strong>Linguistics for Language Teachers</strong>: equips you with the skills required to describe and analyse language. It does not assume prior knowledge of Linguistics and seeks to introduce you to selected fundamental concepts, relevant to English language teaching. You acquire appropriate terminology and techniques in the analysis and description of grammatical terms and structures.</p>
<p><strong>Second Language Acquisition</strong>: How do we learn languages? Does it make any difference what age we start at? Why do some learners seem to do better than others? Answers to these questions, and many more would be very useful to inform language teachers, and to guide learners. This module explores theories of second language acquisition to gain some understanding of what learners actually do, how learners differ, and the strategies they can use. This knowledge and understanding is evaluated in order to apply theory to practice.</p>
<p><strong>Education and Researching</strong>: teachers are increasingly expected to be evidence-informed or even evidence-led; consuming, creating, and sharing research. This module addresses how we evaluate the quality of research to decide what is rigorous and informative for our practice, how we can build on existing research when planning our own interventions, and how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. We consider a range of research contexts and values to help you actively engage with pedagogical research.</p>
<p>The modules listed in this course page are indicative. There is no guarantee they will run for 2023 entry, and some elements may be subject to change for 2023 entry.</p></div>

	                	<div class='tab-pane fade' id='tab-2' role='tabpanel'><p>Those on the MSc and PGDip programmes will choose three modules from the following list. If you are studying for the PGCert, you can choose any four modules from this list or from the compulsory module list.</p>
<p>If you are taking TESOL with a specialism, one of these modules must be related to the specialism.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>: brings together the study of language testing with the theory and practice of assessment in pedagogy. You will learn key concepts in both, how to design and improve tests for different purposes, and how to make productive use of assessment within teaching. We also consider some of the broader social impacts of assessment and testing and how teachers navigate tensions when promoting student learning within a measurement culture. The module also acts as an example of learning through assessment, giving you opportunities to reflect on how different approaches such as mastery learning or active learning are reflected in assessment design, as well as critiquing aspects of assessment such as the use of time limits, group tasks, multiple-choice questions, and gamification.</p>
<p><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>: In recent years there has been a rapid increase in the teaching of academic subjects through English in countries where the majority of the population do not use English as a first language. This module explores this global trend from the standpoint of content and language teachers, as well as students. It considers the wide variety of English medium instruction contexts, evaluating theory in the fields of teaching and learning, language acquisition and intercultural communication in an attempt to address some of the practical challenges involved.</p>
<p><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>: explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition, namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management. There is also a practical element to the module, in the form of tasks requiring you to create lesson plans and materials to share with your peers, to apply theory to practice.</p>
<p><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>: introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices of technology in language education. You will be able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.</p>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered. Some modules may only allow limited numbers of students. See the University&rsquo;s position on <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">curriculum development</a>.</p>
