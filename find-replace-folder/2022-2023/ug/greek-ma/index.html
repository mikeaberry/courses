<p>The course involves study of the many different genres of ancient Greek literature, from tragedy and epic to lyric poetry and philosophy, historiography and oratory. You will be required to develop skills of reading and understanding these texts in the original language. In the process you will also gain a broad understanding of ancient social, cultural and political history.</p>

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The MA (Hons) in Greek is a four-year course run by the School of Classics. In the first year, if you have not studied Greek previously, you will be introduced to Greek language and literature from scratch through our intensive language courses. If you have already studied Greek at a higher level, in your first year you will undertake more advanced study in language and literature in modules that integrate the study of literary texts with linguistic and translation exercises.</p>
<p>Alongside Greek, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually continue to study at least one of these subjects. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In second year, all students are brought together to take modules that extend and refine their knowledge of Greek literature and its background, covering both prose and poetry from the archaic to the imperial period, while continuing to incorporate progressive work on Greek language skills in preparation for Honours-level study. Extra support classes are provided for students who began Greek at St Andrews.</p>
<p>The skills you gain in analysing original Greek texts will prepare you for exploring an even wider range of texts at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to delve deeper into a specialist topic of your choice in writing a dissertation during your fourth year.</p>
<p>All of the School’s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes. Topics may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greek poetry, including epic and tragedy</li>
<li>Greek historiography, including authors like Herodotus and Thucydides</li>
<li>Greek rhetoric</li>
<li>Greek philosophy</li>
<li>religion in Greek literature</li>
<li>Greek comedy</li>
<li>Greek literature in the Roman Empire.</li>
</ul>
<p>A wide choice of other modules is available to complement Greek and suit your interests. Popular choices include classical studies, ancient history, English literature, modern languages, medieval and modern history, philosophy and divinity.</p>
<p>Students wishing to study both Greek and Latin should consider choosing <a href="../classics-ma/index.html">Classics MA (Hons)</a> instead.</p>
<p>Graduates in Greek from St&nbsp;Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge of ancient Greek literature and culture and a high level of competence in Greek language.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, language classes and set-text reading classes (10 to 30 students).</p>
<p>At Honours level, all teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading Greek texts</li>
<li>practising language and translation skills</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Greek and classics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all Greek staff&nbsp;on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/people/">School of Classics website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Classics, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page.</a></p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Almost all modules in Greek are assessed by a combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>research essays</li>
<li>literary criticism and commentary exercises</li>
<li>linguistic analysis</li>
<li>class tests, including unseen translation and grammar exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements.

                <p>The University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first-year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions, and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from, ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Greek may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/classics/">Bacchae Society</a> is the student society for everyone with an interest in all things classical.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/archaeology/">Student Archaeological Society</a> holds regular meetings, covering both archaeological and classical topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and St Salvator’s Quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ class library. The class&nbsp;library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes. It is a lovely additional study space for students in the School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.

<h3>Tuition fees</h3>

The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University&rsquo;s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
