<p>The School will not consider applicants who have progressed to second year.

No credit for the undergraduate year is given as all entrants must complete the full six years of the medical degree.</p>

<p>To be considered for interview, applicants must have achieved (or be predicted to achieve) the following grades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper second or first class Honours degree in Science (or equivalent) obtained within the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;three years prior to entry.</li>
<li>B&nbsp;grade in Chemistry at Higher or A-Level, or at Advanced Higher.</li>
<li>B grade in Biology, English and Mathematics at GCSE or equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Guidance</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Applicants whose undergraduate degree is more than&nbsp;three years old will not be considered, unless an applicant has continued directly into PhD level study. Applicants who have continued directly into PhD study will be considered if their PhD degree is under three years old.</li>
<li>A lower second class Honours degree followed by a second degree (first or upper second class Honours, Masters or PhD) will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Those who have previously studied on undergraduate medicine degree programmes will not be considered.</li>
<li>Applicants can re-sit Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology and English qualifications to achieve the required grade (or grades) if not achieved at the time of leaving school.</li>
<li>Examples of qualifications or study that might be accepted instead of Higher/Advanced Higher/A level Chemistry:
<ul>
<li>20 credits of undergraduate level Chemistry at high grades.</li>
<li>Modules of mixed science (for example, Biochemistry) are not accepted &ndash; modules must be pure Chemistry.</li>
<li>Open University &ndash; Chemistry: essential concepts module S215 &ndash; 60% or above.</li>
<li>SAT Chemistry &ndash; 700+</li>
<li>University of Glasgow - Access to Higher Education: Chemistry (ADED11406E) &ndash; grade B.</li>
<li>Other access courses and HNC qualifications are not accepted as they do not offer enough Chemistry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A GPA of 3.5 is considered to be the equivalent of an upper second class Honours degree. For advice with regard to degree classifications from other countries, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:admissions@st-andrews.ac.uk">admissions@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.</li>
<li>A reference from your university tutor commenting on your academic performance and suitability for medicine should be part of your UCAS application. If you have not yet achieved your degree, the reference should include a predicted degree classification.</li>
<li>Graduates need to supply an academic transcript of their performance at university at the time of application.&nbsp;</li>

	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>Whether you will need to provide an English language test score to evidence your English language ability depends on your educational background.</p>
<p>Applicants who use English as an additional language must achieve 7 in all four components of the International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) exam, to be taken at one sitting. This is irrespective of any other English qualification achieved. Further information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/language-requirements/undergraduate/" target="null">undergraduate English language requirements page</a>.</p>
<p>IELTS scores have a recommended two-year validity period, and this time limit will be applied.</p>
<p>The final four consecutive years of secondary or high school education in an English-medium school may in some cases be considered as evidence of English language ability. This will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and applicants should email <a href="mailto:medical.admissions@st-andrews.ac.uk">medical.admissions@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;for further information. The University of St Andrews reserves the right to ask for additional evidence of English language ability.</p>
<p>The School of Medicine will accept the Academic version of the IELTS only. However, offer holders should also ensure they meet the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-visa/knowledge-of-english">UKVI English language visa requirements</a> where necessary.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>Applicants applying with school-level qualifications must have achieved these within the three-year period prior to the programme start date.</li>
<li>If your school-level qualifications are more than three years old, your next opportunity to apply to the programme will be as a graduate applicant.</li>
