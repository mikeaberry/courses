  <p><span lang="EN">The MMath (Hons) in Statistics allows you to specialise in the branch of mathematics that focuses on collecting, analysing and presenting large quantities of numerical data. There are many practical applications for statistics, including fields such as science and medicine, government, business and education.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Students of statistics will acquire the analytical techniques, clear logical thinking and deductive reasoning necessary to explore some of these fascinating areas of research.</span></p>
<p>The MMath allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree. Students can also take&nbsp;Statistics as a standard&nbsp;four-year&nbsp;<a href="../statistics-bsc/index.html">BSc</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="../statistics-ma/index.html">MA</a>&nbsp;degree.</p>

                <p>Mathematics and statistics at St Andrews is very popular, and the&nbsp;University is unable to make an offer to every applicant who meets or exceeds the entry requirements. The University seeks to recruit students who are enthusiastic about mathematics and possess the demonstrated potential to be successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entry requirements are the same for&nbsp;all single&nbsp;Honours degrees in mathematics and statistics, and the chance of receiving an offer does not depend on the degree or entry point applied for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decisions are primarily based on mathematical ability and potential, as demonstrated by school qualifications and position in class or year. The School of Mathematics and Statistics does not use results from MAT or STEP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants should, therefore, include as much detail about their mathematics results as possible on their&nbsp;application <strong>if available</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Highers: band attained as well as the grade, and ideally the percentage attained for Higher Mathematics.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A-Levels: grades obtained in each of the mathematics modules taken to date, if any.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For guidance on other entry qualifications, please see <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/">entry requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If possible, applicants should include their rank within their year and any awards they have won at school.&nbsp;Applicants should ask their referees to also include this information in their reference.</p>
<p>Applicants should also include any extra-curricular mathematical and scientific accomplishments. This can include, for example, competition results (for example, Maths Challenge and Olympiads) or previous university-level experience (for example,&nbsp;from&nbsp;summer programmes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The MMath (Hons) in Statistics is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Mathematics and Statistics. The course offers advanced study of statistics at postgraduate level during your final year, allowing you to graduate with a Masters degree.</p>
<p>In the first year, your studies will focus on mathematics, with the aim of reinforcing your basic skills before embarking upon the study of statistics in your second year. Your second year will focus on a central core of material within statistics which will provide the foundation for advanced study at Honours level.</p>
<p>Alongside statistics, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study&nbsp;up to&nbsp;two additional subjects. In the second year, students only take mathematics and statistics modules. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>At Honours and Masters level, students may select modules from a range of options on advanced and specialist-specific topics. Specialist subject areas may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bayesian inference</li>
<li>statistical ecology</li>
<li>statistical modelling</li>
<li>times series analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final-year students must also undertake an advanced project on a topic chosen in consultation with teaching staff at the School of Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In first year, teaching for each module centres on a daily lecture (100 to&nbsp;300 students) and a weekly small group tutorial (8 to 12 students) where students undertake exercises and discuss each week’s topics. In addition, computer labs (25 to 60 students) are held once a week for each module to assist with both computing and problem solving skills.</span></p>
<p>In second year, each module typically comprises five lectures (100 to 300&nbsp;students), one tutorial (8 to 12 students), and one examples class (25 to 60 students) per fortnight. Half of the modules also feature computer lab sessions (25 to 60 students).</p>
<p><span lang="EN">You will develop increasing independence and initiative as you progress through your degree programme so that by third, fourth and fifth year the average teaching load drops to around ten hours of lectures and four tutorials per week, supplemented by private study.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and computer labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of statistics.&nbsp;Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials, examples classes and computing classes under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>Find contact information for all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/">Statistics staff</a> on the School of Mathematics and Statistics website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available </a>through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities.

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Progress is monitored through tutorial assignments, and almost all of the modules are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and written exams.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements.

<p>Demand for mathematically trained graduates vastly outstrips the supply, and hence career prospects are excellent in a variety of fields.</p>
<p>Recruiters seek numerate graduates who are literate, think logically, write and present well, and can work with relevant technology – St Andrews degrees develop all of these skills.</p>
<p>A mathematics degree is recognised as a substantial achievement in a demanding discipline.</p>
<p>Around 30% of St&nbsp;Andrews mathematics and statistics graduates continue on to postgraduate study, either in mathematics or related disciplines such as computer science, finance, or physics.</p>
<p>The majority&nbsp;of the remaining graduates gain employment in areas including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>technology firms or computer consultancies</li>
<li>financial services organisations (for example, Goldman Sachs, KPMG, and PwC)&nbsp;</li>
<li>industry</li>
<li>insurance companies</li>
<li>merchant banks</li>
<li>the civil service</li>
<li>teaching.</li>

Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first-year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions, and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from, ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Statistics students may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/maths/">Mathematical Society (SUMS)</a>, a society dedicated to bringing people together who are interested in maths. They hold regular socials and informative talks from guest speakers.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The School of Mathematics and Statistics is currently&nbsp;located across&nbsp;two sites: the Mathematical Institute on the North Haugh and the Scott Lang Building at the Observatory. Most of the statistics staff and research students can be found at the Observatory.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>Admission to the University of St&nbsp;Andrews is governed by our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/policy/">admissions policy</a>.</p>
<p>Information about all programmes from previous years of entry can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/">archive</a>.</p>
<h2>Curriculum development</h2>
<p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>.</p>
<h3>Tuition fees</h3>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University&rsquo;s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
