  <p>Comparative Literature at St Andrews opens up literary study across boundaries of culture and language. It offers students the chance to read texts of any genre, of any period, and written in a multitude of languages, all in English translation. Drawing on expertise from across modern languages and beyond,&nbsp;the programme considers the relationships that exist between literatures around the world, allowing students to push at the boundaries of textual analysis and read without borders.</p>
<p>As well as exploring the different cultural, socio-political, and historical forces that have helped form national and transnational canons, the course also focuses on close reading and&nbsp;introduces you to comparative methodologies and literary theories, developing your analytical, descriptive, and evaluative skills. You will have the opportunity to read, discuss, and present reasoned arguments, and work on writing with precision, clarity and creativity.</p>
<p>Whilst St&nbsp;Andrews does not offer Comparative Literature as a single Honours degree, you can take it in combination with a wide variety of other subjects as part of a joint Honours degree.</p>
<p>If you are taking Comparative Literature with a modern language, you will have the opportunity to take an integrated year abroad between second and third year in a country in which the language you study is spoken.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The Comparative Literature element of the four-year joint Honours degree course is run by the School of Modern Languages.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will gain awareness of different genres and themes as they appear in a range of literatures (typically including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Persian, Russian, Spanish, Latin American, British and North American). You will address the issue of how to study literature comparatively, especially when reading in translation. This will equip you with the range of literary experience and critical skills necessary for a more in-depth study of specialist subject areas at Honours level.</p>
<p>Specialist subject areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>adaptation and intermediality</li>
<li>cultural memory</li>
<li>digital&nbsp;media</li>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p class="normal1">Comparative literature modules involve traditional lectures supported by small discussion seminars. Lectures provide information, stimulate thought, and suggest directions for further reading and personal study. Small group seminars allow you to work&nbsp;with your peers and your tutors to discuss texts, theories and methodologies in detail.</p>
<p class="normal1">Sub-honours comparative literature modules are delivered through lectures (100 to 150 students) and small-group tutorials (10 to 15 students). At Honours level, lectures are replaced by seminars&nbsp;of 8 to 15 students.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures and tutorials, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading set primary and secondary texts</li>
<li>preparing for seminar discussions</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by leading researchers in the field with an emphasis on research-led teaching. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p class="normal1">You can find contact information for all Comparative Literature staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/modern-languages/people/">School of Modern Languages website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Modern Languages, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>

                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Comparative literature sub-honours modules are assessed by 50% coursework and 50% written examination. Assessment at Honours level varies, with most modules being assessed entirely by coursework.&nbsp;Coursework covers a wide range, from traditional essays and commentaries to more creative modes (for example writing and commenting on a short story; writing a censor’s report; devising your own syllabus)</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The Department&nbsp;aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please see the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale</a>.</p>

Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first-year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions, and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from, ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Comparative literature students may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/book-club/">Book Club</a>&nbsp;holds regular meetings to discuss books and create a welcoming society for all.&nbsp;</li>

As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>.</p>
<h3>Tuition fees</h3>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University&rsquo;s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
