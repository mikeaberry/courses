  <p>The BA (International Hons) in Classical Studies offers two pathways: Greek and Latin, or Ancient History and Archaeology. Both pathways allow you to explore the cultures of the Mediterranean world in great depth, from the Bronze Age through Late Antiquity. You will also have the option to take courses from both pathways, giving you an all-round perspective on the Greek and Roman world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BA (International Hons) is a joint degree delivered by both the University of St&nbsp;Andrews and the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia, USA. This joint degree allows you to spend two years at each institution.</p>

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The BA (International Hons) in Classical Studies is a four-year course run jointly by the School of Classics at St&nbsp;Andrews and the Department of Classical Studies at the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/classicalstudies/">College of William &amp; Mary.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will study for two years at both St&nbsp;Andrews and William &amp; Mary, spending the first year of the programme at one institution and the second year at the other. You will then be able to choose where you wish to spend your third and fourth years of study and graduate from either university.</p>
<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>If you study a BA (International Honours) in Classical Studies, you will choose between two pathways: Greek and Latin, or Ancient History and Archaeology.</p>
<p>If you choose the Greek and Latin pathway, you will be able to take both Greek and Latin at complete beginners' level or at more advanced level if you have substantial previous experience.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">If you choose the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway, you will be introduced to, and given advanced training in, the history and material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The BA (International Honours)&nbsp;is a single Honours degree, and other combinations – such as joint Honours degrees – are not available with this programme. However, during the programme you will have opportunities to study a range of other subjects offered by both institutions.

            <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>This programme offers an impressive range of modules that students can take without losing the depth of focus by following either a language or ancient history and archaeology pathway.</p>
<p>Working together, the classics departments from both universities offer a unique range of modules. For example, students are able to pursue coursework in Etruscan archaeology and Egyptology (at William &amp; Mary) as well as modules in Late Antique and Bronze Age archaeology (at St&nbsp;Andrews): this unusual combination of modules is hard to find in any single department. The programme also provides Greek and Latin language students with a more flexible degree, one which can be tailored to your level of study between the two institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Undertaking a classics degree in both campuses will also allow students a wider range of postgraduate opportunities in North America and the United Kingdom. As a student on the programme, you will have the unique advantage of knowing the UK and US systems well should you wish to make postgraduate applications.</p>

<p>Students on the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway who spend their first year at St&nbsp;Andrews must take the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Greeks in a Wider World:&nbsp;</strong>surveys Greek history from the origins of the Greek city-states in the Archaic period (ca. 800 BCE), through the heyday of Athens’ empire and democracy in the fifth century and the struggle for supremacy among the Greek cities in the fourth, to Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Persian Empire. Alongside political and military history, the module tackles topics such as religious belief, slavery, and Greek interactions with other peoples of the ancient Mediterranean world.</li>
<li><strong>Rome and the Mediterranean</strong>: traces Rome’s trajectory from a small settlement in central Italy to the centre of a Mediterranean empire. The module examines a wide range of topics, including politics, the family, religion, slavery, poverty and the economy. It exposes the links between the growth of Rome’s power abroad and the transformation and eventual collapse of its Republican government at home and the rise of the first emperor, Augustus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on this pathway are strongly encouraged to take two modules of Latin or Greek alongside Ancient History in their first year.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Greek and Latin pathway</h4>
<p>Students on the Greek and Latin pathway who spend their first year at St Andrews must choose one of the following Latin or Greek module pathways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary Latin 1 and 2</strong>: provides an introduction to the Latin language for beginners, concentrating on morphology, vocabulary, and basic syntax.</li>
<li><strong>World of Latin 1 and 2&nbsp;</strong>(only available to students who have studied Latin to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): enhances understanding of Latin language and literature through study of both verse and prose set texts and regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>Elementary Greek 1&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Greek Literature for Beginners</strong>: provides a thorough grounding in the Greek language for beginners or near beginners, and prepares students for the challenge of reading and interpreting Greek literature.</li>
<li><strong>Greek Language and Literature 1&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Greek Pastoral and Passion </strong>(only available to students who have studied Greek to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): involves detailed study of a range of set texts as well as linguistic and translation exercises designed to enhance students' knowledge of Greek and confidence in reading Greek literature in its historical and cultural context.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><h4>Ancient History and Archaeology pathway</h4>
<p>Students on the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway who spend their second year at St&nbsp;Andrews must choose two of the following compulsory modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Roman Empire</strong>: explores the complex history of the Roman Empire from Augustus to Late Antiquity, an empire which, for the first and last time, united the whole Mediterranean and its diverse hinterlands. The history and archaeology of the empire are studied through the themes such as power, society, cultures, the army and the frontiers,&nbsp;cities, economies, and religions. How did an ever-changing imperial monarchy oversee a relatively stable, slave-owning domain? What powers of coercion and persuasion did Rome exert? How was Rome and its empire culturally transformed over the centuries?</li>
<li><strong>Mediterranean Communities</strong>:&nbsp;examines the history and archaeology of human settlement in the Mediterranean world throughout the whole of classical antiquity. In the course of the first millennium BCE and the first half of the first millennium CE (ca. 1000 BCE to 500 CE), the Mediterranean was transformed from a world of tiny peasant and tribal communities to a world of complexly connected cities, states and empires. This module brings together themes of ecology, economy, urbanism, networks and the state to ask big questions about how and why classical civilisation emerged when and where it did.</li>
<li><strong>Early Greek Poetry and Philosophy</strong>: studies the earliest phases of the Greek literary and philosophical tradition in the archaic and early classical Greek world. It explores the diversity of early Greek thought through the poetry and philosophy of the period, and explores themes of conflict, justice, love and the relationship between mortals and gods.</li>
<li><strong>Culture and Thought in the Late Roman Republic</strong>:&nbsp;studies the art and literature of Rome in the Late Republic (first century BCE). Key literary texts, such as the passionate poetry of Catullus and the stylish rhetoric of Cicero, are set against the broader backdrop of Roman political, cultural and social life in this turbulent period of civil war and dictatorship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students on the Ancient History and Archaeology pathway are also strongly encouraged to take two modules in either Latin or Greek in their second year.</p>
<h4>Greek and Latin pathway</h4>
<p>Students on the Greek and Latin pathway who spend their second year at St Andrews continue their exploration of Greek and Latin language and literature by choosing one of the following Latin or Greek module pathways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latin in Progress 1 and 2</strong>: examines a wide range of texts in both prose and verse from the Republican and Imperial periods, and enhances Latin language skills through regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>Latin Language and Literature 1 and 2&nbsp;</strong>(only available to students who have studied Latin to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): builds on 'World of Latin 1 and 2'; examines a wide range of texts in both prose and verse from the Republican period and enhances Latin language skills through regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>The Landscape of Greek Prose (B) and Poetry (B)</strong>: examines a wide range of Greek prose texts and ancient poetry, and enhances Greek language skills through regular language classes.</li>
<li><strong>The Landscape of Greek Prose (A) and Poetry (A)&nbsp;</strong>(only available to students who have studied Greek to SQA Higher, GCE A-Level or equivalent): examines a wide range of Greek prose texts and ancient poetry, and enhances Greek language skills through regular language classes.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Students will spend either their third or fourth year in St&nbsp;Andrews. You will be able to choose from a wide variety of advanced options.</p>

<p>If at St&nbsp;Andrews for fourth year, students will have the opportunity to undertake a 10,000-word dissertation on a topic of their choice. This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The compulsory modules listed here must be taken in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules appropriate to the programme for the current academic year can be found in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/2020-21/list.html?v=dp">programme requirements</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Students who are at St&nbsp;Andrews for their first or second year will be taught through a mixture of lectures, seminars, language classes and set-text reading classes.</p>
<p>In third or fourth year, all teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students at St&nbsp;Andrews are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading Greek or Latin texts</li>
<li>practising language and translation skills</li>
<li>reading ancient source material in translation</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>At St&nbsp;Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Greek, Latin, ancient history and archaeology. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/people/">contact information for all&nbsp;classical studies staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of Classics website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first-year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions, and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from, ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Classical studies students may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/classics/">The&nbsp;Bacchae Society</a>&nbsp;is the student society for everyone with an interest in all things classical.&nbsp;</li>

<h2>Curriculum development</h2>
<p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>.</p>
<h3>Tuition fees</h3>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University&rsquo;s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
