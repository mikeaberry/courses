		<p>- We're in the main clinical skills suite up on the top floor of the Medical School, and we have four rooms very similar to this. We use these rooms for clinical teaching for all three years of the course, and we do a mixture of teaching up here, usually practical skills, so learning skills like blood pressure, how to examine chest, how to examine the heart and abdomen, and things like that.</p>
<p>- The students are involved in some of the common investigations that they might be looking at in a patient who has diabetes, so they're testing urine for diabetic changes and testing blood glucose as well. This helps to give the students a flavour of how the investigations they might do in common practice integrate and relate to the patient that they've seen in the previous rules of the patient they have examined, the patient they've taken a history from. They then put all of those three things together to come up with an integrated feel of how patient management works in real life, and this really helps prepare them for practice when they will come across these types of situations.</p>
<p>- The anatomy facility on the top floor of the new Medical School, which was built in 2010, was a wonderful facility that we designed ourselves, and it provides the best sort of facility for anatomy teaching in the country.</p>
<p>We have a group of young doctors who spend a year with us who are the mainstay of our teaching and the dissecting room. They are taking time out after fully qualifying as doctors to teach medical students anatomy and clinical skills.</p>
<p>In the first year, the students study anatomy in a broad way to begin with but thereafter they will concentrate on the systems of the body, and so each of the systems is considered in turn and dissection takes place alongside clinical teaching here in the dissecting room.</p>
<p>- It's so much more useful in terms of really understanding and getting your head around the way the human body works. You can see a hundred pictures and never really understand how something fits together until you see it in a live body. I definitely think it's the best way to learn.</p>
<p>- We teach a systems-based curriculum which is integrated across all the medical science disciplines, and so the anatomy is based around the systems that are being taught in different<br>areas. So we dissect, for example, the cardiovascular system while we're also looking at the function and pharmocology which is associated with the cardiovascular system, and microbiology and so on. So everything to do with the cardiovascular system would be studied and researched. The anatomy is an integral part of that, because it's an important cornerstone of medical practice.</p>
<p>- It's really helpful to see the structures that you're learning about in a lecture where everything is colour-coded and then see it in the human body and really understand how everything fits together.</p>
<p>- In order to make sure we can graduate our students out with a BSc Honours in Medicine, we have to make sure they've got a solid understanding of the scientific bases that underpin medicine. And to help do that, we're not only delivering lectures that give the didactic content, the backbone to the understanding for the student that the scientific basis of medicine, but we also put that into practical context using the facilities here within the School.</p>
<p>This is a research-intensive School as well as being a teaching School. There's a variety of staff that involved in both delivering the content within the labs and also in the lecture theatre. They have research facilities on the second floor of this building. They often bring ideas down to how to augment our practicals and how to put a slant on some of the teaching to really contextualise it in the practical application.</p>
<p>- Communication skills is an integral part of the curriculum here at St&nbsp;Andrews. It's important for many reasons, but one of the main ones is it means better outcomes for patients at the end of the day.</p>
<p>- The communication skills practicals are - it might just be because of my group - but I find them a lot of fun.</p>
<p>- I really enjoy the communication skills training. There's demonstrators that help the whole way.</p>
<p>- It's a safe environment. We use simulated patients who are actors who play the role of patients, and that means that students can practice some of the communication techniques that we're discussing with them in an environment where they know that it's not going to have any consequences for a real patient.</p>
<p>- I'm one of a team of simulation patients who come down here to the Medical School. Increasingly, of course, as patients of medics, we very much hope that these students will be good communicators, that they will communicate well with their patients. And that's as important as their medical and technical skills.</p>
<p>- Our actors that we use as simulated patients are incredibly effective. Students are immersed in a room: they're on their own with the patient - a simulated patient - and they do have a feeling that this patient is experiencing the difficulties that they're talking about.</p>
<p>- When considering to come here, I was quite keen because it was such a small university and such a good ratio of teaching staff to students, and I think that definitely helps with my progression throughout the years here.</p>
<p>So living in St&nbsp;Andrews is an excellent place to live. In my first year, I lived in student halls which were very close to Medical School, and for the past two years I have lived in the centre of town.</p>
<p>- Aside from being a great place, I love the traditions: May Dip, the Sunday pier walk.</p>

                <p>ScotGEM is a unique and innovative four-year graduate entry medicine programme run by the universities of St&nbsp;Andrews and Dundee. Our collaboration with four health boards - NHS Fife, Tayside, Highland and Dumfries and Galloway - along with the University of Highlands and Islands, allows us to deliver a truly distinctive programme.</p>
<p>The programme addresses all core MBChB requirements as stipulated by the General Medical Council (GMC). Whilst ScotGEM&nbsp;focuses on enthusing graduates to become generalist practitioners with experience in rural health care, the programme will prepare students for any branch of medicine through the normal postgraduate training process.</p>
<p>ScotGEM&nbsp;aims to produce a cohort of high quality, adaptable and compassionate clinical leaders. You will contribute to local communities and the health service whilst in training through supported 'Agents of Change' projects in all four years.</p>
<p>Agents of Change goes beyond the core required by the GMC. It enables ScotGEM students to learn and attempt to bring about real change in health care delivery. This aspect of the course is based on five themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>informatics</li>
<li>quality improvement</li>
<li>prescribing and therapeutics</li>
<li>public health</li>
<li>community engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents of Change helps learners understand, develop and practise the skills required to generate change in complex systems.&nbsp;It involves taught materials, visiting speakers and related project work to help students develop their expertise. For example, students might work within a group of general practices to research and analyse prescribing patterns before helping to implement improvements. Agents of Change represents the majority of the ‘student selected’ element of the programme and is also a key opportunity to develop related scholarly outputs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an intensive graduate programme&nbsp;where students are expected to study and work long terms (around 40 weeks per year). From second year onwards, components of the programme will include periods of living and studying in rural areas of the Highlands and Dumfries and Galloway. You must be prepared to live and study in this context.</p>

For example, a case of sore throat might lead into examination of the throat and neck, related anatomy, microbiology, pharmacology and related public health issues.</p>
<p>The complexity and challenge of the cases builds as you and your peers become more effective learners. Case-related clinical and communication skills will be introduced alongside topics such as biochemistry, pharmacology and anatomy.</p>
<p>Semester 1 will use cases that focus on foundational medical sciences; this knowledge will subsequently underpin more challenging scenarios.</p>
<p>Semester 2 concentrates on the body systems where you will learn examination skills in conjunction with the relevant regional anatomy.</p>
<p>During this year, for one day a week, you will be engaged in small-group, work-based learning supported by a dedicated team of GP teachers or ‘generalist clinical mentors’ in a local general practice. This will include regular clinical experience and patient contact from the outset.</p>
<p>Agents of Change projects will include a voluntary sector placement and prescribing improvement project.</p></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>This year introduces a further 20 patient scenarios structured around the lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teaching in Year 2&nbsp;is delivered across three regions, enabling placements in Fife, Inverness, and Dumfries. Teaching will take place simultaneously across the three regions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be prepared to live and study away from St&nbsp;Andrews for between 12 to 24 weeks during Year 2. The location of your study will be based on regional quota and student preference, if possible.</p>
<p>Student accommodation will be provided for placements outside Fife.</p>
<p>You will continue to work for&nbsp;one day each week with a generalist clinical mentor in the GP setting and spend an additional half a day in a specialist clinical environment. Year 2 closes by providing experience of unscheduled care (GP, emergency department, ambulance, etc) and project work related to Agents of Change.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In Year 3, you will undertake a 'longitudinal integrated clerkship' (LIC) where you will join a general practice over the course of a year rather than taking part in ‘traditional’ clinical rotations. This apprenticeship-style educational model allows you to follow patients through their illness journeys.</p>
<p>Approximately half of your week&nbsp;will be spent consulting with patients, the remainder studying the conditions you have encountered or following your patients into the secondary care setting. This approach works especially well for graduate learners and has been shown to develop more patient-centred doctors with improved decision-making skills.</p>
<p>Agents of Change activities run in parallel with your clinical learning during this period.</p>
<p>LIC placements will be available in all four partner health board areas, but the majority will be in rural areas and weighted towards Highland and Dumfries and Galloway. You must be prepared to live and study away from Fife and Tayside.</p></div><div id="modules-year-4" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>As a competent generalist student, you will now be immersed in the hospital environment and prepare yourself for work as a junior doctor. You will complete two month-long foundation apprenticeships and other hospital-based clinical attachments in final preparation for practice as a Foundation Year&nbsp;1&nbsp;doctor.</p>
<p>You may choose clinical areas of particular interest which you can experience in greater depth. You will also arrange an eight-week clinical elective period which can take place anywhere in the world and will be focused on your own objectives.</p>
<p>You will also conduct a healthcare improvement project in a hospital setting.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

<p>ScotGEM uses a wide range of teaching methods, much of which will be delivered within an NHS setting. A case-based learning approach in the first two years will prepare you for an exciting range of clinical learning opportunities in third and fourth years.</p>
<p>The ScotGEM course&nbsp;is based on clinical cases from the outset. These will be supported by:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning objectives</li>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>practical classes</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>simulated and ‘real’ clinical and consultation skills</li>
<li>extensive supported independent and peer-peer learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your learning will be underpinned by a sophisticated online Curriculum Management System, which will give you access to a wide range of resources and enables&nbsp;you to monitor your progress, particularly during Year 2 when the students will be located in different regions. For instance, regular online self-assessment tests and workplace-based learning assessments will be required.</p>
<p>Increasingly, learning will become more self-directed, and you will&nbsp;need to rely on yourself and your peers to explore, investigate and learn from the cases (still guided by clear learning objectives and with synchronised centrally organised teaching). This approach will set you up well for learning based on real patients in the clinical environment.</p>
<p>The longitudinal integrated clerkship in Year 3 will allow you to join a clinical team and learn whilst becoming increasingly involved in patient care. You will select patients to follow through and study them, their conditions and their care in more detail. Where relevant, you will attend specialist clinics, operations, etc as you follow these individuals’ journey through the healthcare system.</p>
<p>Finally, in Year 4, you will experience intensive hospital attachments that involve shadowing foundation doctors and other secondary care attachments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Each year will require you to pass assessments of knowledge, clinical skills and a portfolio demonstrating professional development.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Years 1 and 2, you will be assessed on your knowledge using a mix of online multiple choice questions and short answer written assessments. Year 3 will use online multiple choice questions aligned with the planned General Medical Council common exam (Medical Licencing Assessment).<br><br></li>
<li>In every year, there will be a portfolio assessment based on a mixture of engagement with learning, workplace-based performance and project work related to the curriculum themes.<br><br></li>
<li>In every year, there will be an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).</li>
</ul>
<p>The assessments&nbsp;are selected specifically for the ScotGEM course, but draw heavily upon those available within both medical schools. Thus, your progress will be benchmarked against existing UK standards throughout.</p>
<p class="basicparagraph">Students must pass all of their modules each year to progress to the subsequent year.</p>
