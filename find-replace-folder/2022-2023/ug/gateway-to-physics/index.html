  <p>The Gateway to&nbsp;Physics and Astronomy provides an alternative entry route, with built-in additional support, for Scottish students who meet some or all of the University's widening participation criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Gateway entry year, you will study the same mathematics module and core physics modules as students on the traditional entry route, as well as some modules that are available only to those on the Gateway programme. The Gateway-specific modules aim to develop important academic skills within the context of astrophysics, physics, and mathematics study.</p>
<p>After successfully completing your first year, you will be able to&nbsp;progress from the Gateway programme to the second year of&nbsp;one of the degree programmes in physics&nbsp;and related subjects.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The&nbsp;Gateway to&nbsp;Physics and Astronomy is the first year of a four or five-year&nbsp;course run by the School of Physics and Astronomy.&nbsp;After the&nbsp;Gateway entry year,&nbsp;students will&nbsp;have the opportunity to progress into the second year of one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSc or MPhys Physics</li>
<li>BSc or MPhys Astrophysics</li>
<li>BSc Mathematics and Physics</li>
<li>MPhys Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gateway programme provides a highly supported and interactive first year. About half of your modules&nbsp;are from existing St Andrews physics and mathematics modules where you will be taught alongside other first-year students. Your other modules&nbsp;are specially designed modules for the Gateway cohort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gateway-only modules introduce and reinforce relevant physics, mathematics and study skills. Students in the Gateway-only modules will benefit from a highly supportive learning environment and small class sizes (typically no more than 15 students). These modules have been designed to encourage group work and will provide a forum for student-led exploration of a variety of&nbsp;physics topics.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>Physics and astronomy modules are taught through a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and laboratory work.</p>
<p>Physics 1A and Physics 1B typically consist of four or&nbsp;five lectures per week (around 120 to 150 students), along with one problem-solving workshop, one small group tutorial (around 8 students), and 2.5 hours in the teaching laboratory. Laboratory work is usually undertaken in pairs in first year.</p>
<p>The Gateway-specific modules typically have no more than 15 students working with an instructor. These sessions take a variety of forms, most of which are highly interactive workshops and laboratory sessions. There is a mix of direct instruction, individual and group-based problem solving with feedback, development of experimental investigation and reporting skills, and private study with tutor support.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing for laboratory work</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of physics and astronomy, and will have significant interaction with staff within the School. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>Academic staff from the School who are teaching on the Gateway programme provide support and advise on a wide range of matters. Students on this Gateway programme benefit from significantly more contact hours per week than most other students in the School.</p>
<p>You can find&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/">contact information for staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of Physics and Astronomy website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long-term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Most modules are assessed by a mix of coursework and written examinations. Most modules give a higher weighting to written examinations, but some are assessed solely through coursework.</p>
<p>Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>laboratory work</li>
<li>classroom tests</li>
<li>presentations</li>
<li>reviews of research papers</li>
<li>tutorial participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet, and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within a time specified for the assignment – in some cases two days, in some cases two weeks. Feedback is given with a view to improving your performance in the future.</p>
<p>For further information on the University's&nbsp;grading&nbsp;procedure, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale</a>.</p>

                <p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students come from across Scotland, across the UK, and around the world to join an international community of students and staff, and all join the University from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>The relatively small size of the town means that students get to meet easily with many other students. Some of the optional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/traditions/">student traditions</a>&nbsp;help with this mixing. Most entrant students live in University-managed accommodation. There are over 150 student societies and sports clubs to choose from. This can all help to ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students of Physics may be interested in joining the following student academic societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/astro/">Astronomical Society</a>&nbsp;(Astrosoc) runs a range of events from stargazing to an annual ball.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/physics/">Physics Society</a>&nbsp;(PhySoc) promotes the understanding and enjoyment of physics. PhySoc hosts a number of events including lectures, an annual ball, day trips and pub nights.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/maths/">Mathematical Society</a>&nbsp;(SUMS) organises talks on mathematics as well as lunchtime gatherings and pub nights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Physics and Astronomy is situated in a modern building located on the western edge of the town.&nbsp;Most teaching is currently conducted in this building, which includes computing and research facilities specifically for the use of astrophysics and physics students.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
