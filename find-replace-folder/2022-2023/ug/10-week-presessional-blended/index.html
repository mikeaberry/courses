			<h3>2022 entry</h3>
<p>This blended learning pre-sessional course&nbsp;includes six weeks of online tuition followed by four weeks of study in St&nbsp;Andrews. It is designed to prepare you for your degree programme by focusing on the academic language and skills required for success at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews. You will develop your ability to use English in academic contexts, as well as learn about academic, social and cultural life in St&nbsp;Andrews.</p>
<p>In summer 2021, 97% of students who studied on a pre-sessional course at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews achieved the scores required to progress onto their intended degree programme.</p>

		<h2 class="alert__heading">Lockdowns and difficulties with flights in your region?</h2>
		<p>You have an option to study this course entirely online. However, the online course option is an emergency measure to allow you to study your pre-sessional course if difficulties caused by Covid restrictions in your region prevent you from taking a UKVI approved test or if difficulties finding flights prevent you from attending the last four weeks of the course in person.</p>
<p>You should consider the online course option carefully as <strong>you will only be able to begin your visa application when you have completed the course and have achieved the required grade for your degree course, resulting in a delay to your arrival in St Andrews.</strong> Applicants with an intention to study this course online must request this by uploading an <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/language-requirements/profiles/aepc-online/" target="null">approved certificate</a> when submitting an application. If this is not from a UKVI approved centre, we will contact you and ask if you wish to do the course online. If your certificate is UKVI approved, we will assume that you wish to come in person unless you tell us that you would prefer to do the course online.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact <a href="mailto:summerstudy@st-andrews.ac.uk">summerstudy@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.</p>

                <p>This intensive course will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enhance your academic English</li>
<li>develop your academic skills</li>
<li>learn about studying at the University of St Andrews as a postgraduate student&nbsp;</li>
<li>adapt to living and studying in the UK</li>
<li>meet English language offer conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The course consists of an online phase and an on-site phase in St Andrews.</p>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<h4>Online phase</h4>
<p>During the online phase, you will participate in online learning activities for approximately 18 hours per week, and will work individually on assignments. Online learning activities will typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>watching lectures and other videos created for the course</li>
<li>completing interactive worksheets or online tasks</li>
<li>contributing to discussion forums</li>
<li>engaging in peer assessment of written work</li>
<li>joining live video tutorials or English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also have to submit assignments and will receive electronic feedback from your teacher.</p>
<p>The online phase only includes formative assessments, which do not count towards your final grade. You will receive feedback on your assessments to help you enhance your ability before taking summative assessments (which do count towards your final grade) in the on-site phase. You are expected to participate fully in online learning activities, and your participation will be monitored.</p>
<h4>On-site phase</h4>
<p>The on-site&nbsp;phase of the course consists of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes, combined with academic lectures and seminars. These sessions will help you to enhance your academic reading, writing, listening and speaking skills, as well as your understanding of good academic practice in higher education.</p>
<p>You will have a mix of both online and in-person teaching over the four weeks of the phase, which will be equivalent to approximately 18 guided study hours per week. Most of your in-person tuition will be in small groups, normally with 16 or fewer students.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert alert--info">
<p>Some or all in-person teaching on this course may change to online teaching depending on health and safety measures in summer 2022.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3>Assessment and learning outcomes</h3>
<p>During the course, you will be tested across the four skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking using assessments that are benchmarked to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). You will be awarded an overall grade on the University of St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point scale to reflect your performance on course assessments, as well as individual scores for each of the four skills.</p>
<p>Overall grades and individual skill scores are benchmarked to CEFR levels as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>a score of 4-6 is equivalent to CEFR B2- level</li>
<li>a score of 7-10 is equivalent to CEFR B2 level</li>
<li>a score of 11-13 is equivalent to CEFR B2+ level</li>
<li>a score of 14-16 is equivalent to CEFR C1- level</li>
<li>a score of 17-20 is equivalent to CEFR C1 level.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see how these grades and scores compare with those on other tests using&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/language-requirements/profiles/reference-tables/">CEFR benchmarking table for English language tests</a>.</p>
<p>Pre-sessional grades and scores can be used to meet English language offer conditions, provided that the pre-sessional is listed in the English language test profile for a subject area. See <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/language-requirements/postgraduate/">English language requirements for postgraduate students</a>&nbsp;for more details.</p>
<p>Students who complete this course with an overall score of&nbsp;14 or higher should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write clear, well-structured texts on complex topics in an appropriate style&nbsp;for their field, using supporting evidence and examples from sources as required.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Give clear, well-structured presentations on complex subjects in their field, expanding and supporting points of view with appropriate reasons and examples.</li>
<li>Demonstrate detailed understanding of a wide range of lengthy, complex texts where stated opinions and implied points of view are discussed, given time to reread where necessary.</li>
<li>Demonstrate sufficient understanding to follow extended speech on abstract and complex topics of academic relevance.</li>
<li>Produce work that demonstrates an understanding of good academic practice and scholarship, including strategies to avoid plagiarism.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other features of the course</h3>
<p>The course introduces students to different services across the University, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Library</li>
<li>Student Services</li>
<li>Careers Centre</li>
<li>Sports Centre</li>
<li>Music Centre.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Progression requirements</h3>
<p>In addition to maintaining satisfactory attendance on the course, you must also achieve an overall grade and individual skill scores to meet the requirements of your chosen degree programme.</p>
<p>You can check the overall grade and individual skill scores you need to achieve for your subject area by looking at the:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Curriculum development</h2>
<p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>.</p>
<h3>Tuition fees</h3>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University&rsquo;s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
