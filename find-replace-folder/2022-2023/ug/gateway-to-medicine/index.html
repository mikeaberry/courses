		<p>- We're in the main clinical skills suite up on the top floor of the Medical School, and we have four rooms very similar to this. We use these rooms for clinical teaching for all three years of the course, and we do a mixture of teaching up here, usually practical skills, so learning skills like blood pressure, how to examine chest, how to examine the heart and abdomen, and things like that.</p>
<p>- The students are involved in some of the common investigations that they might be looking at in a patient who has diabetes, so they're testing urine for diabetic changes and testing blood glucose as well. This helps to give the students a flavour of how the investigations they might do in common practice integrate and relate to the patient that they've seen in the previous rules of the patient they have examined, the patient they've taken a history from. They then put all of those three things together to come up with an integrated feel of how patient management works in real life, and this really helps prepare them for practice when they will come across these types of situations.</p>
<p>- The anatomy facility on the top floor of the new Medical School, which was built in 2010, was a wonderful facility that we designed ourselves, and it provides the best sort of facility for anatomy teaching in the country.</p>
<p>We have a group of young doctors who spend a year with us who are the mainstay of our teaching and the dissecting room. They are taking time out after fully qualifying as doctors to teach medical students anatomy and clinical skills.</p>
<p>In the first year, the students study anatomy in a broad way to begin with but thereafter they will concentrate on the systems of the body, and so each of the systems is considered in turn and dissection takes place alongside clinical teaching here in the dissecting room.</p>
<p>- It's so much more useful in terms of really understanding and getting your head around the way the human body works. You can see a hundred pictures and never really understand how something fits together until you see it in a live body. I definitely think it's the best way to learn.</p>
<p>- We teach a systems-based curriculum which is integrated across all the medical science disciplines, and so the anatomy is based around the systems that are being taught in different<br />areas. So we dissect, for example, the cardiovascular system while we're also looking at the function and pharmacology which is associated with the cardiovascular system, and microbiology and so on. So everything to do with the cardiovascular system would be studied and researched. The anatomy is an integral part of that, because it's an important cornerstone of medical practice.</p>
<p>- It's really helpful to see the structures that you're learning about in a lecture where everything is colour-coded and then see it in the human body and really understand how everything fits together.</p>
<p>- In order to make sure we can graduate our students out with a BSc Honours in Medicine, we have to make sure they've got a solid understanding of the scientific bases that underpin medicine. And to help do that, we're not only delivering lectures that give the didactic content, the backbone to the understanding for the student that the scientific basis of medicine, but we also put that into practical context using the facilities here within the School.</p>
<p>This is a research-intensive School as well as being a teaching School. There's a variety of staff that involved in both delivering the content within the labs and also in the lecture theatre. They have research facilities on the second floor of this building. They often bring ideas down to how to augment our practicals and how to put a slant on some of the teaching to really contextualise it in the practical application.</p>
<p>- Communication skills is an integral part of the curriculum here at St Andrews. It's important for many reasons, but one of the main ones is it means better outcomes for patients at the end of the day.</p>
<p>- The communication skills practicals are - it might just be because of my group - but I find them a lot of fun.</p>
<p>- I really enjoy the communication skills training. There's demonstrators that help the whole way.</p>
<p>- It's a safe environment. We use simulated patients who are actors who play the role of patients, and that means that students can practice some of the communication techniques that we're discussing with them in an environment where they know that it's not going to have any consequences for a real patient.</p>
<p>- I'm one of a team of simulation patients who come down here to the Medical School. Increasingly, of course, as patients of medics, we very much hope that these students will be good communicators, that they will communicate well with their patients. And that's as important as their medical and technical skills.</p>
<p>- Our actors that we use as simulated patients are incredibly effective. Students are immersed in a room: they're on their own with the patient - a simulated patient - and they do have a feeling that this patient is experiencing the difficulties that they're talking about.</p>
<p>- When considering to come here, I was quite keen because it was such a small university and such a good ratio of teaching staff to students, and I think that definitely helps with my progression throughout the years here.</p>
<p>So living in St&nbsp;Andrews is an excellent place to live. In my first year, I lived in student halls which were very close to Medical School, and for the past two years I have lived in the centre of town.</p>
<p>- Aside from being a great place, I love the traditions: May Dip, the Sunday pier walk.</p>

                <p>The&nbsp;Gateway to Medicine is a one-year&nbsp;course&nbsp;taught by the Faculty of Science, but with contributions from staff in the Faculty of Medicine.&nbsp;Students will enter the Gateway to Medicine on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/lifelong-learning/general-degree/">BSc General degree</a> and have the opportunity to progress to the six-year&nbsp;<a href="../medicine-bsc-a100/index.html">Medicine A100 Honours programme</a>.</p>
<p>Students will build on their studies from school by taking first-year&nbsp;level modules in biology and chemistry, along with other modules in any Science or Arts School.</p>
<h3>Progression to a medicine degree</h3>
<p>The aim of the Gateway is to help the student adapt to life at university and provide an entry opportunity&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href="../medicine-bsc-a100/index.html">Medicine A100 Honours programme</a>. However, the Gateway&nbsp;leaves options open for those who are not able to meet the entry requirements for medicine or who decide medicine is not for them.</p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to prepare for transfer to the medicine degree by:</p>
<ul>
<li>undertaking volunteering or work experience in a medical context</li>
<li>obtaining an understanding of professionalism as relevant to medicine</li>
<li>developing academic and non-academic skills relevant to medicine.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to progress onto the&nbsp;<a href="../medicine-bsc-a100/index.html">Medicine A100 degree</a>, students must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>passed all first-year modules at grades specified at the time of entry to the Gateway</li>
<li>a suitable <a href="../medicine-bsc-a100/entry-requirements/ucat/index.html">UCAT score</a> (to be specified by the School of Medicine) achieved either before entry to the Gateway or in the summer immediately after the Gateway</li>
<li>a pass in the multiple&nbsp;mini interviews (to take place during the Gateway year).</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who do not meet the entry requirements for progression to the Medicine A100 programme&nbsp;will remain in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/faculties/science/">Faculty of Science</a> and have the opportunity to transfer onto a BSc Honours programme if they meet the pre-requisites.</p>

                <p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions, and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from, ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Gateway to Medicine students have lectures and practicals in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the JF Allen Science Library. One other area available for students is the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a> in the Bute building, a spectacular zoology museum which includes the arrangement of species to show evolutionary relationships between animals.</p>
<p>Students interested in medicine may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/biology/">Biology Society</a>&nbsp;organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/bute/">Bute Medical Society</a>&nbsp;runs a range of charity events, sports tournaments, cheese and wine evenings, and balls.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/bma/">British Medical Association Society</a>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;official local University branch of the trade union and professional association for medical students and doctors throughout the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
