        <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Do I need to have studied this subject before?</h3><p><p>Most students who enrol on this course have not studied Earth sciences at school, and choose Earth sciences based on a love of the environment, the outdoors, and science.

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The BSc (Hons) in Geology is a four-year course run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences&nbsp;and provides students with a combination of academic skills and vocational training. During your degree, you will be able to take advantage of hands-on field and laboratory-based research projects that investigate topics as varied as the origin of continental crust, to planetary origin and differentiation, to the challenges of finding and harnessing Earth's green energy resources. Your degree will provide key skills training designed to prepare you for working life in a range of environments from PhD research to geotechnical engineering and from mining to environmental protection.</p>
<p>In first year, you will be introduced to the main concepts of geology, such as Earth structure and Earth history, including the origin of the planet and Earth’s biosphere.</p>
<p>In second year, modules provide additional and deeper study into mineralogy, sedimentary systems, palaeontology, geophysics, geochemistry and Earth's surface processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside geology, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Honours level, there is a shift from broad-themed modules to more specialised ones that introduce students to a wide variety of exciting new research trends and findings. Modules involve the opportunity to get first-hand experience of new research discoveries and advances.</p>
<p>The School is home to state-of-the-art analytical facilities supported by full-time technicians. These allow for the detailed characterisation of natural and synthetic materials, culturing of micro and macro organisms in extreme environments, and geological and geophysical field deployment. These facilities will enable you to address questions from fundamental field geology to assess anthropological versus natural processes in driving climate change. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/research">Find out more about research facilities</a>.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission <a href="direct/index.html">directly into the second year of this course</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible for students to take a five-year <a href="../earth-sciences-mgeol/index.html">Integrated Masters course in Earth Sciences</a>, allowing you to graduate with a Master in Geology.</p>

<h3>Fieldwork</h3>
<p>Geology at St&nbsp;Andrews provides outstanding field-based training. Students&nbsp;have the opportunity to take numerous day to multi-week-long field trips associated with individual modules, as well as up to four weeks of fieldwork associated with their independent research projects.</p>
<p>Examples of field trips that are part of the BSc Geology degree include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: the five-day “Highland Fling” to renowned geological sites in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
<li>Second year: six days of geological mapping in central Spain, examining multiple phases of continental collision and mountain building;&nbsp;multiple days providing key field skills for environmental sciences.</li>
<li>Third year:&nbsp;twelve days of mapping the iconic Moine Thrust system and Caledonian igneous complexes in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
<li>Fourth year: a two-week transect of the Alpine orogenic belt through northern Italy and central Switzerland.</li>

<p>Information about all programmes from previous years of entry can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/">archive</a>.</p>
<h2>Curriculum development</h2>
<p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>.</p>
<h3>Tuition fees</h3>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University&rsquo;s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
