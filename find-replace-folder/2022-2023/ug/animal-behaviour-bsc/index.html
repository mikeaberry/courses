		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The BSc (Hons) in&nbsp;Animal Behaviour is a four-year course run by the School of Biology.&nbsp;Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern behavioural biologist.</p>
<p>In the first two years of your degree, you will take the core modules in biology along with modules intended to prepare you for advanced modules in&nbsp;Animal Behaviour specifically.</p>
<p>Alongside biology, in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules that allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, enquiry-based learning.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission <a href="direct/index.html">directly into the second year of this course</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
<p>These facilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>&nbsp;houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
<li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>&nbsp;has excellent facilities for behavioural, ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.</li>

Both of the following modules are compulsory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biology 1</strong>: provides an introduction to molecular and cellular biology. It covers cell diversity and the origins of life, cellular structures and fundamental processes.</li>
<li><strong>Biology 2</strong>: provides an introduction to the diversity of life on Earth and addresses key elements of organismal and ecological aspects of life.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In second year, modules are chosen which will best prepare you for your intended degree (or group of possible degrees) and new topics are introduced in some second-year modules such as evolutionary biology and ecology. Students on the&nbsp;Animal Behaviour course must take the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparative Physiology</strong>: covers the principles of physiological adaptation in a range of animals, including examples from all major taxa and from all habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Biology</strong>: gives an overview of the history and major principles of modern evolutionary biology.</li>
<li><strong>Research Methods in Biology</strong>: develops essential academic and transferable skills, with major emphasis on problem solving. This is achieved through a combination of interactive lectures, independent data-handling workshops and group work on a mini research project.</li>
<li><strong>Vertebrate Zoology</strong>: explores the diversity of vertebrate animals, beginning with the closest relatives of vertebrates and the evolutionary origins of the group.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In third year, you will continue to specialise in&nbsp;Animal Behaviour via a wide range of modules covering core topics. Modules that have been offered in previous years include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Behaviour: A Quantitative Approach</li>
<li>Ecosystems and Conservation</li>
<li>Evolution</li>
<li>Genes, Cells and Development</li>
<li>Terrestrial Zoology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fourth year, you will study your chosen subject area at a deeper scientific level and will also have the opportunity to select from a wide range of small, group-specialised modules. These modules are taught by academics at the forefront of their discipline.</p>
<p>In this year, students also undertake a substantial final year research project. This research project is designed to develop skills in experimental design and problem-solving, the evaluation and interpretation of data, and communication skills.&nbsp;A research project is also undertaken throughout the year.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The compulsory modules listed here must be taken in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules appropriate to the programme for the current academic year can be found in&nbsp;the<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/2020-21/list.html?v=dp"> programme requirements</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>The BSc in&nbsp;Animal Behaviour is taught through a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>practical classes</li>
<li>field work</li>
<li>research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical class sizes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: lectures 250 to 330 students, practicals 80 to 100 students</li>
<li>Second year: lectures 80 to 175 students, practicals 40 to 60&nbsp;students</li>
<li>Third year: lectures 20 to 140 students, practicals 20 to 60&nbsp;students</li>
<li>Fourth year: 5 to 25&nbsp;students per module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are provided with teaching microscopes and are taught in state-of-the-art teaching laboratories. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
<p>Fourth-year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and practical classes you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library or in PC classrooms</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of biology. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all staff in the School of Biology on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/people/">School of Biology website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Biology, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Field trips</h3>
<p>From first year to Honours, students studying&nbsp;Animal Behaviour will also have the opportunity to go on field trips to gather data. Those who have a particular interest in ecology or marine biology will be perfectly located in St&nbsp;Andrews on the shores of the east coast. In Honours years, students can explore further afield&nbsp;where recent courses have visited&nbsp;places such as Indonesia and Antarctica.</p>
<h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
<p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please&nbsp;see the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The University of St Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions, and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from, ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Animal Behaviour students have lectures and practicals in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the JF Allen Science Library. The <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a>&nbsp;in the Bute building houses a spectacular zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.</p>
<p>There’s also the opportunity to join the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/societies/biology/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
