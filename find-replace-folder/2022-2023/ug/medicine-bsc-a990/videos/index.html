		<p>[TEXT:] The Scottish-Canadian Medical Programme</p>
<p>- The Scottish Canadian Medical programme is a unique collaboration by the medical schools of the University of St&nbsp;Andrews, Edinburgh and Alberta. The programme is designed for Canadians who wish to study medicine in the UK and return to practice in Canada.</p>
<p>Students complete the three-year BSc Honours in Medicine at St&nbsp;Andrews before transferring to Edinburgh for years four to six.</p>
<p>In the fifth year of the programme, students spend 18 weeks attached to the University of Alberta in order to prepare for the CaRMS process. Students are assisted for the CaRMS process over the whole six years of the programme by the programme mentor, a professor at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>Students on this programme will return to Canada as international medical graduate doctors six years after leaving high school.</p>

		<p>[TEXT:] Programme Structure - Scottish-Canadian Medical Programme</p>
<p>- The Scottish-Canadian Medical programme is six years long. Students study for the first three years in the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews followed by three years in the Medical School at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>At St Andrews, students will cover medical sciences, core clinical skills mixed with clinical experience, and graduate with an Honours bachelor's degree in medicine.</p>
<p>Following graduation from St Andrews, students automatically transfer to the Medical School in Edinburgh without further interview or application. Students will join the clinical programme at Edinburgh for years four, five and six of their MBChB programme. During the Edinburgh phase, students will spend time on attachment to the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>On completion of the six years, students will graduate as Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, the UK's primary medical qualification. Graduates of the programme will be considered as international medical graduates by the Canadian authorities.</p>
<p>The medical schools at both St Andrews and Edinburgh provide state-of-the-art facilities for teaching, research and learning. The School of Medicine at St Andrews features one of the best-equipped dissection rooms in the UK. The 46-bed clinical skills centre complements teaching delivered in community and in hospitals.</p>
<p>The St Andrew's section of the programme includes basic science, clinical skills, communication skills, anatomy, clinical experience, and applied medical science. All students complete a dissertation which is an integral part of the award of the Honours degree.</p>
<p>Edinburgh's clinical curriculum aims to develop students to their full potential so that they graduate as caring, competent, reflective and confident medical practitioners. Clinical teaching takes place in several locations around the southeast of Scotland, providing a breadth of hospital and community-based experience.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry at Edmonton is a highly respected research-intensive faculty and one of the oldest in western Canada. Students will spend up to 18 weeks on attachment in Canada during the programme. The attachment will include a period of clinical training an enhanced orientation of the Canadian healthcare system and opportunity to train for exams associated with the CaRMS application. Students will also have the opportunity to arrange their own elective in a discipline or region of their choice.</p>

		<p>[TEXT:] What do our students and parents say? - Scottish-Canadian Medical Programme</p>
<p>- St Andrews runs a world-class medical programme. We as parents especially appreciate how traditional teaching is integrated with clinical skills, case learning, labs, dissertation and hospital placement.</p>
<p>- The diversity of having the different programmes that make it a lot more interesting for Dylan, and you'll get a chance to experience St Andrews - a small town in Scotland - the larger city of Edinburgh, and then of course, coming back to Canada and getting some clinical training in Canada would be fantastic.</p>
<p>- If you're interested in medicine, if you're confident about joining medicine as a programme and think that going to the UK would be a good option for you, I would absolutely recommend it.</p>
<p>- What appealed to me about the medical school was that the course is very well run. It's structured very well. You really feel like you're progressing and learning but still retaining a lot of good clinical knowledge as well.</p>
<p>- The academic flavour here is extremely high, which is something my daughter really loves and something, when she looked into this programme, that was probably the thing that struck her the most. So it's been a wonderful experience all around.</p>
<p>- I think that it's an amazing experience. You get a fabulous opportunity to study abroad for six years in Scotland as well as getting a well-rounded and prestigious medical education, and I think that that's something that's invaluable and something that we should jump at the chance to apply for.</p>
<p>- It's been really rewarding, I think that's the word I'd say. It's been a lot of fun with all the friends I've made, but at the same time had been challenged in a really interesting way by the work, and I've just really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>- It's been a great experience for him. The people are very friendly and very accommodating.</p>
<p>- Being able to take what we learned from the lectures and actually take it to placements and seeing how the clinical skills apply in the hospital, it's been great.</p>
<p>- He has had a great relationship with the professors and the students, and the town itself has been a very safe and loving environment for him.</p>
<p>- It's such a contrast from those back home in North America, but the sense of community and how small it is and you feel like you know a lot of people, but there's always those around to give you support and have a good time, and it's a nice balance between school and nightlife and sports and volunteering and things like that.</p>
<p>- I work in academics, I work at a university. Laughlin is my third child. We have been through the experience before, and this is by far the best undergraduate experience of all my children. I absolutely can't say enough wonderful things about it.</p>
