<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA (School of Physics and Astronomy): By having a very strong research-active University that competes with the best internationally, we can teach our postgraduate community how to evolve as researchers, how to work with our peer groups, in a way that wouldn't happen were we have to focus solely on teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ETHAN (PhD Philosophy, Illinois, USA): The research interests of the academic staff was the most important thing when deciding to come here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WEBSTER (PhD Divinity, Malawi): I find being in this place academically challenging, stimulating, and the community is captivating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIA (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, New York, USA): As a student, St Andrews is a world of its own. I just think it is the most brilliant and other-worldly place you could ever have.</p>
<p>- To be a student in St Andrews is the ultimate of student experience in higher education.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Professor JUDITH WOLFE (School of Divinity): St Andrews is a very special university because it is so small and intimate, and yet punches so far above its weight in terms of research, in terms of the calibre of students that we get, and in terms of community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; FIONA (PhD Medicine, Forres, Scotland): The postgraduate community in St Andrews is quite a close-knit one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HOI CHUN (MLitt Marketing, Hong Kong): Very warm and welcoming. Really easy to get to know them just because you are in a small town. You get that sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM (School of Computer Science): St Andrews is a research-intensive University. Most of the teaching staff are research active. So their interests feed into teaching.</p>
<p>- The research really is the life blood of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; NICOLE (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Minnesota, USA): The professors are always putting out new pieces of research. They really are pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIE BROOKS (School of Management): We're very lucky at St Andrews. We have really the best of the best applying, and it means we really get a very, very, high-quality student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR JAMES RAE (School of Earth and Environmental Sciences): We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR CHARLES WARREN (School of Geography and Sustainable Development): People who are willing to be challenged, and also to challenge, and people beyond their studies, people who are keen to contribute to the wider life of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; GABRIELLE (MSc Marine Mammal Science, Chia, Columbia): I've learned a lot of things, and I've made so many contacts.</p>
<p>- It's been the best experience of my entire life. I've loved every second of it.</p>
<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HANNAH (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, Nottingham, England): Life at St Andrews is wonderful. I think it's completely unique. There's so much to do. You cannot be bored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

<h3>Semester 1</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interrogating Sustainable Development</strong>: introduces the problems that sustainable development seeks to address and the tensions that characterise this field; you will also examine how sustainable development intersects with other frameworks for managing our resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Semester 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master Class in Sustainable Development</strong>: develops your understanding of advanced-level sustainability debates by engaging critically with interpretations of sustainability and the ways it stimulates interaction with partners beyond academia to address socio-environmental vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Alongside compulsory modules, students will complete a number of optional modules (normally two per semester). Optional modules allow you to shape the degree around your own personal and professional interests.</p>
<p>It is recommended that students complete modules from the following list:</p>
<p><strong>Semester 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An Introduction to Global Climate Change:</strong> provides the scientific background to understand past, present and future climate change and its consequences globally. Topics will include air pollution, the causes of climate change (especially the anthropogenic greenhouse effect), and climate change denial.</li>
<li><strong>Population Change and Sustainable Development: Patterns, Processes and Politics</strong>: equips students with knowledge of core concepts in population studies and develops critical engagement in the connections between population and sustainability using examples from across the globe and research from a range of social science disciplines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Semester 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Management:</strong> introduces and explores the relevance of environmental management to sustainable development and contemporary debates in environmental policy. Themes include conservation conflicts, managing environmental risks and hazards, and environmental justice.</li>
<li><strong>Health, Inequality and Development:</strong> explores why health is a critical issue for human development that is sustainable, and why social scientists have much to offer an understanding of health that extends beyond its framing as a purely biomedical issue. The module explores how health and well-being are framed and measured, and encourages both an appreciation and healthy scepticism of differing epistemologies and approaches.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Other optional modules are expected to be offered in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>environmental history</li>
<li>green politics: theory and practice</li>
<li>managing natural resources</li>
<li>managing non-governmental organisations</li>
<li>disease and environment</li>
<li>transitioning to sustainability: community, nature and governance</li>
<li>extractive environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University&rsquo;s position on <a href="index.html#d.en.53225" target="null">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The final part of the MSc is the end-of-degree project. This takes the form of a period of supervised research where you will explore a sustainable development topic in depth.</p>
<p>Through the project, you will show your ability to undertake sustained critical analysis, develop and improve your research skills, and produce an extended piece of written work that demonstrates a high level of understanding of your area of study.</p>
<p>You can choose to present your end-of-degree project in one of the following ways: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>a policy report that emphasises your ability to critically assess development policy and make convincing recommendations for policy changes.</li>
<li>a written dissertation that emphasises your ability to plan and execute academically rigorous research (open to students with appropriate methodological experience).</li>
</ul>
<p>If students choose not to complete the project requirement for the MSc, there is an exit award available that allows suitability qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home &raquo; University &raquo; Administration A-Z &raquo; Course Catalogue &raquo; Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>
