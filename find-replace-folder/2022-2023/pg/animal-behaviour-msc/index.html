<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA (School of Physics and Astronomy): By having a very strong research-active University that competes with the best internationally, we can teach our postgraduate community how to evolve as researchers, how to work with our peer groups, in a way that wouldn't happen were we have to focus solely on teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ETHAN (PhD Philosophy, Illinois, USA): The research interests of the academic staff was the most important thing when deciding to come here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WEBSTER (PhD Divinity, Malawi): I find being in this place academically challenging, stimulating, and the community is captivating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIA (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, New York, USA): As a student, St Andrews is a world of its own. I just think it is the most brilliant and other-worldly place you could ever have.</p>
<p>- To be a student in St Andrews is the ultimate of student experience in higher education.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Professor JUDITH WOLFE (School of Divinity): St Andrews is a very special university because it is so small and intimate, and yet punches so far above its weight in terms of research, in terms of the calibre of students that we get, and in terms of community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; FIONA (PhD Medicine, Forres, Scotland): The postgraduate community in St Andrews is quite a close-knit one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HOI CHUN (MLitt Marketing, Hong Kong): Very warm and welcoming. Really easy to get to know them just because you are in a small town. You get that sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM (School of Computer Science): St Andrews is a research-intensive University. Most of the teaching staff are research active. So their interests feed into teaching.</p>
<p>- The research really is the life blood of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; NICOLE (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Minnesota, USA): The professors are always putting out new pieces of research. They really are pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIE BROOKS (School of Management): We're very lucky at St Andrews. We have really the best of the best applying, and it means we really get a very, very, high-quality student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR JAMES RAE (School of Earth and Environmental Sciences): We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR CHARLES WARREN (School of Geography and Sustainable Development): People who are willing to be challenged, and also to challenge, and people beyond their studies, people who are keen to contribute to the wider life of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; GABRIELLE (MSc Marine Mammal Science, Chia, Columbia): I've learned a lot of things, and I've made so many contacts.</p>
<p>- It's been the best experience of my entire life. I've loved every second of it.</p>
<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HANNAH (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, Nottingham, England): Life at St Andrews is wonderful. I think it's completely unique. There's so much to do. You cannot be bored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p><span lang="EN">The MSc in&nbsp;Animal Behaviour is a one-year&nbsp;taught programme run by the School of Biology.&nbsp;This programme has a distinct focus on the theoretical, experimental design-based, analytical and technical approaches underpinning modern animal behaviour research.</span></p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The programme is taught within the School of Biology’s <a href="https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">Centre for Biological Diversity</a>, an internationally recognised centre of excellence for animal behaviour research, including animal cognition, cultural evolution, biologging and the study of complex systems.</li>
<li>A core curriculum focused on training in valuable transferable skills is supplemented with a range of specialised options allowing students to explore topics of particular interest at an advanced level.</li>
<li>You might have the exciting opportunity to conduct fieldwork locally as part of&nbsp;a core module and further afield as part of optional field courses (extra cost applicable) in Antarctica (polar ecology) or Indonesia (scientific diving).</li>
<li>You&nbsp;will undertake a detailed independent research project within one of the School of Biology’s research groups.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Student-led seminars and workshops are designed to support learning, enhance confidence and promote employability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">The course consists of two taught semesters and an independent&nbsp;research project culminating in a written dissertation and poster presentation. The research project takes place during the entire year with particular focus during the last three months from mid-May&nbsp;to mid-August.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Semester 1 focuses on research skills. Students receive training in statistical analysis and data handling, experimental design and conducting animal behaviour research in the laboratory and in the field, including a residential field trip.</p>
<p>During Semester 2,&nbsp;you will select specialist optional modules in topical areas of research and also further develop&nbsp;your professional communication skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modular curriculum is designed to be coherent, providing integrated, hands-on training that will provide a strong foundation for students wishing to further their studies (for example, PhD) or for those choosing to pursue research-focused careers.</p>
<p>Teaching takes the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>debates</li>
<li>workshops</li>
<li>tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practicals involve lab and field work and computer-based data analysis.</p>
<p>Class sizes usually range from 5 to 30 students, depending on the module. There is a strong focus on small-group teaching so that students are individually supported and can ask for help when it is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mathematical and Statistical Modelling for Biologists</strong>: applies mathematical ideas to questions in biology and introduces methods for fitting models to biological&nbsp;data mainly using R software.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Research Skills for Animal Behaviour</strong>: focuses on key skills including experimental design, biologging and telemetry, behaviour genetics, and applications to conservation biology.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In Semester 2, students take the following compulsory module:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication Skills for Animal Behaviour Research</strong>: practices key communication skills for modern animal behaviour research, including writing for other scientists, peer review, communicating with the public and outreach.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also choose&nbsp;three of the following optional modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Predators and Prey</strong>: explore the diverse behaviours that shape the interactions between predators and their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Cognition</strong>: develop an understanding of how animals perceive the world and how their cognitive abilities are shaped by selection.</li>
<li><strong>Current Issues in Biologging:</strong> presents an introduction to the theory and practice of logging and relaying physical and biological data using animal-attached tags.</li>
<li><strong>The Question of Culture in Animals</strong>: discuss the existence and extent of social learning and cultural transmission in non-humans.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Systems in Animal Behaviour</strong>: examine animal behaviour from a complex systems’ perspective, where analyses range from captive housing of entire bird flocks, computer simulation, and use of robots to interact with the animals.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific Diving</strong>: field course located in Indonesia (requires suitable diving qualifications and payment of expedition fee, offered only if international travel conditions allow).</li>
<li><strong>Predator Ecology in Polar Ecosystems - Antarctica</strong>: field course located in southern Argentina and Antarctica (requires payment of an expedition fee which covers all costs, including travel and accommodation). See the&nbsp;<span lang="EN"><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/antarctic/about/">students' Antarctic expedition blog</a>.&nbsp;In case of international travel restrictions, this module will be offered as a St Andrews based course focused on polar research methods and data analysis (at no additional cost).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on <a href="index.html#d.en.53225">curriculum development</a>).&nbsp;</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p><span lang="EN">Throughout the academic year, students complete a research project which will&nbsp;culminate in a written dissertation and presentation of a poster at the MSc student conference.</span> <span lang="EN">Projects will be supervised by Biology staff but may be carried out with joint supervision from staff in other institutions. Students can choose from a range of projects suggested by supervisors and also take an active role in designing their own project plan. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A broad range of research into animal behaviour, ecology and evolution takes places within the Centre for Biological Diversity, and projects will be offered within many of these areas. Below are examples of some of the different topics currently studied within the centre.</p>
<ul>
<li>animal cognition in the wild</li>
<li>animal cultures</li>
<li>behaviour and speciation in insects</li>
<li>behaviour of groups and collective behaviour</li>
<li>behavioural ecology and conservation ecology of birds</li>
<li>complex biological systems</li>
<li>evolutionary developmental biology</li>
<li>fish behaviour and evolution</li>
<li>insect behavioural ecology and evolution</li>
<li>social learning.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MSc, there are exit awards available that allow suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>
