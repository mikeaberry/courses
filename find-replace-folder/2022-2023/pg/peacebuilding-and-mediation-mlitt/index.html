  <p>Peacebuilding and Mediation critically explores the relationship between formal and official peacebuilding and mediation initiatives and informal, unofficial, and community-based efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course is offered as either an MLitt or MPhil:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MLitt is a one-year programme involving two semesters of taught modules followed by a dissertation.</li>
<li>The MPhil is a two-year programme. In the first year, students complete the same components of the MLitt. In the second year, they complete one semester abroad at a partner institute in Europe and&nbsp;one semester on a practical placement. You can apply directly to the MPhil programme, or you may have the opportunity to progress from the MLitt to the MPhil.</li>

<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA (School of Physics and Astronomy): By having a very strong research-active University that competes with the best internationally, we can teach our postgraduate community how to evolve as researchers, how to work with our peer groups, in a way that wouldn't happen were we have to focus solely on teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ETHAN (PhD Philosophy, Illinois, USA): The research interests of the academic staff was the most important thing when deciding to come here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WEBSTER (PhD Divinity, Malawi): I find being in this place academically challenging, stimulating, and the community is captivating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIA (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, New York, USA): As a student, St Andrews is a world of its own. I just think it is the most brilliant and other-worldly place you could ever have.</p>
<p>- To be a student in St Andrews is the ultimate of student experience in higher education.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Professor JUDITH WOLFE (School of Divinity): St Andrews is a very special university because it is so small and intimate, and yet punches so far above its weight in terms of research, in terms of the calibre of students that we get, and in terms of community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; FIONA (PhD Medicine, Forres, Scotland): The postgraduate community in St Andrews is quite a close-knit one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HOI CHUN (MLitt Marketing, Hong Kong): Very warm and welcoming. Really easy to get to know them just because you are in a small town. You get that sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM (School of Computer Science): St Andrews is a research-intensive University. Most of the teaching staff are research active. So their interests feed into teaching.</p>
<p>- The research really is the life blood of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; NICOLE (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Minnesota, USA): The professors are always putting out new pieces of research. They really are pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIE BROOKS (School of Management): We're very lucky at St Andrews. We have really the best of the best applying, and it means we really get a very, very, high-quality student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR JAMES RAE (School of Earth and Environmental Sciences): We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR CHARLES WARREN (School of Geography and Sustainable Development): People who are willing to be challenged, and also to challenge, and people beyond their studies, people who are keen to contribute to the wider life of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; GABRIELLE (MSc Marine Mammal Science, Chia, Columbia): I've learned a lot of things, and I've made so many contacts.</p>
<p>- It's been the best experience of my entire life. I've loved every second of it.</p>
<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HANNAH (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, Nottingham, England): Life at St Andrews is wonderful. I think it's completely unique. There's so much to do. You cannot be bored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p>The MLitt and MPhil in Peacebuilding and Mediation are run by the School of International Relations. The programmes showcase the School’s world-leading research strengths in the broad field of peace and conflict studies, including in peacebuilding and mediation of conflict.</p>
<p>In this course,&nbsp;you&nbsp;will:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>analyse bottom-up and top-down approaches to conflict mediation&nbsp;</li>
<li>conceptualise peace and its relationship to violence&nbsp;</li>
<li>analyse relationships between formal institutions of peacebuilding and parallel informal or unofficial processes&nbsp;</li>
<li>identify key actors involved in peacebuilding and mediation efforts&nbsp;</li>
<li>engage with bottom-up approaches to building peace&nbsp;</li>
<li>explore feminist and decolonial critiques of formal peace processes&nbsp;</li>
<li>critically engage with temporalities and spaces of peace and violence.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The focus of this programme on peacebuilding and mediation ensures that the study of conflict focuses not only on violence, its actors, and modalities, but also on the different insights deriving from critical engagement with processes of peace.</li>
<li>The programme is strongly influenced by postcolonial, feminist and critical theory.</li>
<li>The programme locates and analyses both global and more local cases of peacebuilding and mediation, building on Scottish strengths of community-based mediation, conflict resolution, and peace promotion.</li>
<li>The opportunity to benefit from the expertise of a practitioner-in-residence in peacebuilding and mediation, and from active engagement in the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at St Andrews.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Year 1 (MLitt and MPhil)</h3>
<p>Both programmes consist of four taught modules taken over two semesters. Modules are taught through a mixture of lectures, seminars and tutorials.</p>
<p>Average lecture sizes range from 20 to 30 students, and tutorial sizes range from 1 to 15 students.</p>
<p>Assessment methods include a combination of examination and coursework.</p>
<p>During the summer of Year 1, MLitt students will complete a 15,000-word dissertation in an area of&nbsp;their choice. Every student is assigned a dissertation supervisor who will advise on the choice of subject and provide guidance throughout the research process. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="index.html#d.en.53225">Further particulars regarding curriculum development</a>.</p>
<h3>Year 2 (MPhil only)</h3>
<p>Students studying for the MPhil will also complete one semester abroad at a partner institute in Europe. Subject to availability, students might be able to undertake study placements with current partners, such as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• University of Tromsø – The Arctic University of Norway, Centre for Peace Studies, Norway<br>• University of Tampere, Tampere Peace Research Institute, Finland<br>• Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Germany <br>• Philipps University of Marburg, Center for Conflict Studies, Germany<br>• University of Hamburg – Institute for Peace Research and Security Studies, Germany<br>• University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany <br>• University of Belgrade, Faculty of Political Science, Serbia<br>• The Swedish Defence University, Stockholm, Sweden. </p>
<p>MPhil students will also complete a semester of research practice placement either abroad or within the UK.&nbsp;You will choose from pre-approved academic and practitioner partners but can, with permission, propose and arrange&nbsp;your own research practice placement.</p>
<p>The goal of the practice placement extends beyond work experience and is instead designed around a research collaboration between the student and research practice partner. Assessment will be based on the submission of a substantive final research report (70%) and an additional reflexive writing assignment of 3,500 words focused on the practice-based learning that has occurred during the placement (30%).</p>

Drawing from both theoretical analyses and applied study of peacebuilding efforts worldwide, the module examines the actors, settings, temporalities, challenges, and opportunities involved in the making of peace.</li>
<li><strong>Mediation: Community and Global Praxis:</strong> identifies the historical, conceptual, and theoretical underpinnings of conflict resolution practices; analyses diverse forms of mediation, including ‘Track 1’ diplomacy, third-party mediation, and state- and community-led approaches; and, evaluates differential outcomes of mediation processes based on literature review, case studies, and in-class simulation.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Students choose two optional modules.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of particularly appropriate optional modules that may be offered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>African Political Thought:</strong> examines the main ideas of the great Africanist thinkers e.g. Du&nbsp;Bois, Garvey, Fanon, Nyerere, Nkrumah, Senghor, Cabral, Biko&nbsp;etc&nbsp;and discuss how these intellectuals reacted to the internal and external variables to evolve a body of ideas which together could be viewed as African political thought.</li>
<li><strong>Agency and Strategy in Non-Western Political Thought:</strong> explores different elements of non-Western thought to understand assumptions about the body, political community and the world.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Critical Security Studies:</strong> examines the challenge to traditional conceptions of security presented by the emergence of critical security studies since the end of the Cold War.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Global Constitutionalism:</strong> explores global constitutionalism from a political theory perspective focusing on three concepts: law, power, and rights.</li>
<li><strong>International Relations of the Modern Middle East:</strong> looks at the formation of the Middle East regional system, its special characteristics, and the impact on it of the global system.</li>
<li><strong>Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict:</strong> familiarises&nbsp;students with different approaches that seek to explain how ethnicity and nationhood are created and maintained, how different forms of ethnic conflict and ethnic violence come about, and what possible mechanisms to contain nationalism and ethnic conflict are.</li>
<li><strong>Political Economy of Conflict</strong>: provides a political economy perspective on conflict in a developing economy.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Religion and International Politics:</strong> investigates the so-called 'global resurgence' of&nbsp;politicised&nbsp;religion.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Security and Justice Institutions in World Politics</strong>: examines the role of different international institutions in governing world politics.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Spaces of Securitization:</strong> explores how securitization unfolds in theory and in practice by investigating the ‘spatial turn’ in international relations.</li>
<li><strong>Terrorism and Liberal Democracy:</strong> explores the development of contemporary terrorism and the conceptional and definitional issues concerning terrorism.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>The Changing Face(s) of Diplomacy: Emotions, Power and Persuasion in International Relations:</strong>  highlights the role of emotions, persuasion and communication technology into the diplomatic arena. </li>
<li><strong>The Global Politics of Everyday Life:</strong> explores how everyday life and global politics are co-constitutive by drawing on a range of interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>The Military in Politics:</strong> introduces students to civil-military relations and then analyses how armed forces impact states domestic politics.</li>
<li><strong>Theories of Friendship and Enmity:</strong> addresses a number of classical texts in western political thought on the themes of friendship and enmity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students&nbsp;(see the University's position on <a href="index.html#d.en.53225">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The final element of both the MLitt and the MPhil is a 15,000-word dissertation. The dissertation should focus on an area of peacebuilding or mediation in which you&nbsp;are interested. Each student is supported by a relevant supervisor from the School who will advise on the choice of subject and provide guidance throughout the research process. The completed dissertation must be submitted by the end of August.</p>
<p>If MLitt students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement, there are exit awards available that allow suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MLitt.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2022 entry.

<ul>
<li>human rights</li>
