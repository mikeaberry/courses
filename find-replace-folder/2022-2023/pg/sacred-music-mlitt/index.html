		<p>[TEXT: MLitt in Sacred Music]</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR GEORGE CORBETT [Senior Lecturer in Theology and the Arts]: We're very excited about this collaboration between our School of Divinity and the University of St Andrews Music Centre here in St Mary's College, where Theology has been taught for almost 500 years.</p>
<p>Our MLitt presents a unique opportunity to reflect together about what makes music sacred, about why music is so important for the church and for wider society today, about some of those theological, pastoral, aesthetic considerations that have shaped and that continue to shape the extraordinary diversity of sacred music in different Christian worship traditions, denominations and cultures.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; SIR JAMES MACMILLAN [Professor of Theology and Music]: They say that music is the most abstract of the arts, but we also know that music has deep roots in our culture and especially our Judeo-Christian culture, and it's not just in the past, it's actually in the 20th and now the 21st centuries as well. You can find this search for the sacred at the heart of modernism, at the heart of modernity. Composer after composer finding new ways to tease out the mysterious and the divine.</p>
<p>It's very exciting that a new course like this MLitt, here at the University of St Andrews, will allow scholars and artists and composers and theologians to explore that bigger context in our joint search for the sacred.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; CLAIRE INNES-HOPKINS [Director of Chapel Music]: St Salvator's Chapel Choir is our flagship choir here at the University of St Andrews. The choir's history extends back to the founding of the University in the early 15th century. Nowadays we sing three services per week, including repertoire spanning the six centuries of the University's history.</p>
<p>We also regularly commission and perform new sacred music including our recent premiere and recording of six new works as part of our TheoArtistry Composers Scheme.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR MICHAEL DOWNES [Director of Music]: If you decide to come and study sacred music here in St Andrews, you'll instantly become part of a vibrant musical community. We have literally hundreds of concerts and performances each academic year, and represented in our programmes are some of the UK's leading artists.</p>
<p>Ensembles in residence of the University include artists of the calibre of the Fitzwilliam String Quartet, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the Wallace Collection. If you come and study here, you'll have the chance not only to hear these artists and others like them but also to study with them, to make music with them and to learn from their insights.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR MICHAEL FERGUSON [Coordinator of Academic Music]: One of the core aspects of our Masters is that those working on it are active in sacred music outside of the University walls.</p>
<p>Our Masters retains close links with a variety of churches and worship traditions. Within that, we're open to the full range of approaches to sacred music-making.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR GEORGE CORBETT: Our MLitt is a standalone qualification, but for some, it will also be a stepping stone, a launchpad for further doctoral research.</p>

                <p>The MLitt in Sacred Music is a one year full-time or two years part-time taught programme and is run&nbsp;jointly by the School of Divinity's&nbsp;<a href="http://itia.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts (ITIA)</a>&nbsp;and the University of St Andrews&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/music/">Music Centre</a>.</p>
<p>The course is aimed at those intending to carry out church music performance and leadership roles, clergy,&nbsp;and those seeking a self-contained programme of study in sacred music or planning to pursue doctoral research in the field.</p>
<p>Students&nbsp;will deepen their understanding of the theological and artistic underpinnings of sacred music-making, and, where applicable, will&nbsp;develop their practical skills of sacred music performance and leadership.</p>
<p>The University of St Andrews has a range of unique music facilities for Sacred Music students, including the new state-of-the-art Laidlaw Music Centre. Students will be supported by ITIA and Music Centre staff who have research and practical expertise in sacred music.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<li>Develop skills relevant to your area of specialism in music making (e.g. composition, choral directing, organ, instrumental music in worship) or in music journalism and lecturing.</li>
<li>Gain insights into the theological and philosophical underpinnings of music in worship, both in the past and in the present day.</li>
<li>Study at the School of Divinity, based in the ancient St Mary’s College Quad, and at the University of St Andrews Laidlaw Music Centre.</li>
<li>Receive expert tuition from musicians and scholars working actively in the field of sacred music, including Sir James MacMillan, composer and professor of Theology, Imagination and the Arts.</li>

<li><strong>Music and the Sacred in Theory and Practice</strong>: introduces students to the wide diversity of music in its relation to the sacred, in and outside different denominational church contexts. It addresses topics such as the sacred in pop music, music theatre, and opera, as well as in contemporary Christian music, Gregorian and contemporary chant, traditional Catholic and Anglican music, and the relationship between music and liturgy in different Christian denominations.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Making Music in a Church Context</strong>: invites students to reflect upon the practical role of a church musician in its different facets and contexts. In exploring roles such as choir director, organist, composer, and worship ensemble leader, students gain a better understanding of the technical, organisational, and interpersonal skills required for successful church music-making.&nbsp;Weekly seminars with specialist church music practitioners allow all students to engage critically with different types of church musicians. Specialist small group teaching allows theoretical insight to be developed alongside practice-based competency.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Sacred Music in the West: History and Context</strong>: focuses on the history and development of sacred music-making in a variety of confessional traditions informed by Western musical practice. Students explore when, where, and why Christians have made music in their worship.</li>

<p>Elective choices are subject to the approval of the course coordinator and subject to change each year. Some also may require a minimum number of participants or only allow limited numbers of students (see the University's position on <a href="index.html#d.en.53225">curriculum development</a>).&nbsp;</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The end-of-year assessment provides students the opportunity to draw together the theoretical, philosophical, and professional practice strands of the course. Students may choose from either a research or practical assessment.</p>
<p>Students choosing a research assessment must complete a 12,000-word dissertation on a topic in sacred music of their choice. Student dissertations will be supervised by members of the teaching staff who will advise students in their choice of subject and provide guidance throughout the research process.</p>
<p>Those choosing a practical project have the choice of either a recital of sacred music with a written exegesis of research on the programme (5,000 words) or a composition portfolio of sacred music with critical reflection (5,000 words).</p>
<p>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MLitt, an exit award is available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will receive a PGDip instead of an MLitt.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>
