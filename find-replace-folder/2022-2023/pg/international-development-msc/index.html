		<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR ALI WATSON [International Development Practice, Programme Coordinator]: The academic aims of the Masters in International Development Practice are to give students core knowledge of development theory and development practice and intellectual developments in the field.</p>
<p>The practical skills go alongside that - they'll learn from practitioners what it's like in the field. I think that develops a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KASHMIRI: It's a very different experience than in my undergraduate, and this is definitely more independent studies: the less time in classes, the more your independent research really focuses on what you want to and with you taking initiative.</p>
<p>- It's noticeable in the class that you have a community of students because they're in classes a lot of the time, and they work together and deal with things together.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KASHMIRI: The diversity enhances the whole programme, not only with the coursework we're learning, but also with interactions in class and outside of the classroom too. I feel like I fell into a very great community here.</p>
<p>- That interaction they have with different kinds of learning is really useful. You will not only know the discourse surrounding development, but you'll know how to work within that and have some skills that you can take to potential employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;KASHMIRI: I do feel that I'm learning a lot and will be able to apply this to my future development and career.</p>

                <p>International development seeks to enable a global reduction in poverty and improvement in human health and wellbeing. On the MSc in International Development Practice, you will explore the theoretical and practical aspects of international development work.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aimed at students intending to follow a career in international development.</li>
<li>Introduces key topics in development studies, providing a broad-based overview of the field.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary character helps you to develop a more rounded understanding of international development questions and concepts.</li>
<li>Applied components provide a bridge between the theory of development studies and the real-world challenges faced by development practitioners.</li>
<li>Integrated training programme connects your academic learning with the development of personal and professional competencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MSc in International Development Practice is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and an emphasis on applied skills that will be of particular value if you are looking to follow a career in international development.</p>
<p>International development is inherently interdisciplinary. On this MSc subject experts from across the University explore how different academic disciplines understand the character and process of international development.</p>
<p>In this way, you will engage with critical perspectives on the nature of development and international development strategies. You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of international development questions and concepts and learn how to critically discuss development interventions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.</p>
<p>Optional modules allow you to explore topics such as environmental change, population change, and gender that shape development needs and responses and which will further develop the interdisciplinary character of your studies.</p>
<p>Applied components provide a bridge between the theory of development studies and the real-world challenges faced by development practitioners. You will learn skills commonly needed in international development work and develop your understanding of the nature of development careers.</p>
<p>Particular attention is paid to data methods; you will look at how quantitative and qualitative data can be used to assess development interventions and become confident in critically assessing the evaluation plan of a development initiative. You will learn how to describe and perform tasks undertaken by development practitioners and hands-on practical classes provide training in activities such as budgeting and fundraising. More broadly, you will learn practical skills in explaining development concepts to different audiences and the translation of academic thinking on development into recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.</p>
<p>The MSc also considers different types of international development roles. You will be encouraged to think about some of the challenges arising from development careers and ways in which these can be overcome.</p>
<p>The MSc includes an integrated programme of skills workshops that connect your academic learning with the development of personal and professional competencies. Workshops bring together students from other Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies Masters degrees, helping you make new interdisciplinary connections.</p>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>The taught modules are taken over two semesters – September to December (Semester 1) and January to May (Semester 2). The period from June to August is used to complete the end of degree project.</p>
<p>Each taught module will use teaching and learning methods appropriate to its aims. These may include seminars, workshops, lectures, tutorials, and independent study.</p>
<p>Assessment methods used may include essays, reports, presentations, practical exercises, reflective exercises, and examinations.</p>

<h4><strong>Semester 1</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>International Development Studies</strong>:&nbsp;explores how different academic disciplines understand international development and critically discusses development interventions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.</li>
<li><strong>Introductory Data Analysis: </strong>covers essential statistical concepts and analysis methods relevant for commercial analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Semester 2</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working in International Development</strong>:&nbsp;acts as a bridge between the theory of development studies and the real-world challenges faced by development practitioners; you will learn applied skills commonly needed in international development work and develop your understanding of development careers.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Optional modules allow you to broaden your learning in key topics relevant to the MSc.</p>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on <a href="index.html#d.en.53225">curriculum development</a>).</p>
<p>The modules offered in previous&nbsp;year&nbsp;covered areas such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>global politics</li>
<li>population change and sustainable development</li>
<li>gender theory</li>
<li>health inequality and development</li>
<li>managing non-governmental organisations</li>
<li>managing people in global markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The available optional modules will be confirmed before the MSc start date, and you will be able to discuss your choices with an academic adviser before teaching begins.</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The final part of the MSc is the end-of-degree project. This takes the form of a period of supervised research where you will explore an international development topic in depth.</p>
<p>Through the project, you will show your ability to undertake sustained critical analysis, develop and improve your research skills, and produce an extended piece of written work that demonstrates a high level of understanding of your area of study.</p>
<p>You can choose to present your end-of-degree project in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>a policy report that emphasises your ability to critically assess development policy and make convincing recommendations for policy changes</li>
<li>a multi-media portfolio that emphasises your ability to present development concepts in exciting and engaging ways.</li>

<p>If students choose not to complete the project requirement for the MSc, there&nbsp;is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/graduate-school/">Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies</a>&nbsp;was established in 2017 to foster interdisciplinary postgraduate education and scholarship.</p>
<p>The ability to work across subject boundaries is now recognised as an essential skill. The Graduate School’s Masters degrees will help you to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of your subject and to use ideas from different disciplines to illuminate your studies.</p>
<p>As well as their interdisciplinary character, the Graduate School's Masters degrees are distinguished by an emphasis on the development and application of practical skills. In addition to broadening your subject knowledge, you will develop your skills of critical thinking and creativity, analysis and appraisal, problem-solving and decision-making, and project management and personal leadership.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing aspects of joining the Graduate School is&nbsp;the&nbsp;welcoming interdisciplinary community. The Graduate School is a place where you can make social and intellectual connections across subject boundaries and where students form close networks within and across their Masters degree groups.</p>
