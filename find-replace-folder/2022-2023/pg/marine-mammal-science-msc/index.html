<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA (School of Physics and Astronomy): By having a very strong research-active University that competes with the best internationally, we can teach our postgraduate community how to evolve as researchers, how to work with our peer groups, in a way that wouldn't happen were we have to focus solely on teaching.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; ETHAN (PhD Philosophy, Illinois, USA): The research interests of the academic staff was the most important thing when deciding to come here.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; WEBSTER (PhD Divinity, Malawi): I find being in this place academically challenging, stimulating, and the community is captivating.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIA (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, New York, USA): As a student, St Andrews is a world of its own. I just think it is the most brilliant and other-worldly place you could ever have.</p>
<p>- To be a student in St Andrews is the ultimate of student experience in higher education.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Professor JUDITH WOLFE (School of Divinity): St Andrews is a very special university because it is so small and intimate, and yet punches so far above its weight in terms of research, in terms of the calibre of students that we get, and in terms of community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; FIONA (PhD Medicine, Forres, Scotland): The postgraduate community in St Andrews is quite a close-knit one.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HOI CHUN (MLitt Marketing, Hong Kong): Very warm and welcoming. Really easy to get to know them just because you are in a small town. You get that sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM (School of Computer Science): St Andrews is a research-intensive University. Most of the teaching staff are research active. So their interests feed into teaching.</p>
<p>- The research really is the life blood of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; NICOLE (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Minnesota, USA): The professors are always putting out new pieces of research. They really are pioneers in the field.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; JULIE BROOKS (School of Management): We're very lucky at St Andrews. We have really the best of the best applying, and it means we really get a very, very, high-quality student.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR JAMES RAE (School of Earth and Environmental Sciences): We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; DR CHARLES WARREN (School of Geography and Sustainable Development): People who are willing to be challenged, and also to challenge, and people beyond their studies, people who are keen to contribute to the wider life of the University.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; GABRIELLE (MSc Marine Mammal Science, Chia, Columbia): I've learned a lot of things, and I've made so many contacts.</p>
<p>- It's been the best experience of my entire life. I've loved every second of it.</p>
<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HANNAH (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, Nottingham, England): Life at St Andrews is wonderful. I think it's completely unique. There's so much to do. You cannot be bored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p>The MSc in Marine Mammal Science is a one-year taught programme run by the <a href="http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU)</a>, the only UK institution dedicated exclusively to marine mammal research.&nbsp;The MSc further draws on the quantitative and diverse academic expertise within the University's <a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">Scottish Oceans Institute (SOI)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although focused on marine mammals, this programme also covers advanced topics in quantitative marine ecology and animal behaviour.</li>
<li>Modules include intense training in quantitative techniques (for example, statistical modelling and GIS) and applied research methods, including a Scotland-based field course to practice survey techniques (at no additional cost).</li>
<li>Students might have the exciting opportunity to conduct fieldwork and training in Antarctica as part of the optional module in polar ecology (requiring additional payment of a substantial expedition fee). See the <a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/antarctic/about/">students' Antarctic expedition blog</a>.</li>
<li>The core curriculum is complemented by advanced optional modules in topical research areas of biologging, bioacoustics, behaviour and cognition, and population biology.</li>
<li>Stimulating, small class sizes with a focus on student-led, experiential learning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>The course consists of two taught semesters and&nbsp;an independent&nbsp;research project culminating&nbsp;in a 15,000-word dissertation and poster presentation. The research project takes place during the entire year with particular focus during the last three months from mid-May&nbsp;to mid-August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modular curriculum is designed to be coherent, providing integrated training for future careers in scientific research, management or conservation.</p>
<p>Teaching takes the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>debates</li>
<li>workshops</li>
<li>tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Practicals involve lab work, field work, modelling and computer-based data analysis.</p>
<p>Class sizes usually range from 5 to 30 students, depending on the module. There is a strong focus on small-group teaching so that students are individually supported and can ask for help when it is needed.</p>

</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Students choose three optional modules in Semester 2. Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of five participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students&nbsp;(see the University’s position on <a href="index.html#d.en.53225">curriculum development</a>).</p>
<p>Here is a sample of optional modules that may be offered.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced Bioacoustics for Marine Mammal Science:</strong> theoretical and practical application of techniques used to study marine acoustics.</li>
<li><strong>Current Issues in Biologging:</strong> presents an introduction to the theory and practice of logging and relaying physical and biological data using animal-attached tags.</li>

<li><strong>Population Biology:</strong>&nbsp;covers the essentials of population dynamics and population modelling including population genetics, trophic interactions and spatial dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Predator Ecology in Polar Ecosystems - Antarctica:</strong> theoretical and practical field course involving ship-based travel from&nbsp; Argentina to Antarctica (requires payment of an expedition fee which covers all costs, including travel and accommodation). See the <a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/antarctic/about/">students' Antarctic expedition blog</a>. In case of international travel restrictions this module will be offered as a St Andrews based course focused on polar research methods and data analysis (at no additional cost).&nbsp;</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p><span lang="EN">Throughout the academic year, students complete a research project which will&nbsp;culminate in a written dissertation and presentation of a poster at the MSc student conference. Projects may involve some fieldwork but will be primarily focused on the analysis of existing data. Projects will be supervised by SMRU staff but may be carried out with joint supervision from staff in other institutions. Students can choose from a range of projects suggested by supervisors and also take an active role in designing their&nbsp;own project plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MSc, there are exit awards available that allow suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2022 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

		<p>"Given the uniqueness of this MSc degree on marine mammals, I had very high expectations before I started my year in St Andrews - and not only did the programme live up to my expectations, it went above and beyond them. This year was intense, but not only because of the workload but also interacting and being taught cutting-edge research by many inspirational marine mammal scientists. St Andrews is a unique town where friendships are intensified and long-lasting. But most of all, I believe the people I met through this programme, the connections I made and the knowledge I gained have opened many doors for my future in this field."</p>
