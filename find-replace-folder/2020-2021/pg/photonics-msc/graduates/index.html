<p><img src="https://archive.st-andrews.ac.uk/courses/assets/university/subjects/images/physics/0IMG_3152.jpg" alt="" style="    "/></p>
<p>Pictured above are&nbsp;MSc and PhD graduates from the School at the December 2017 graduation ceremony. Graduates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aine, working in&nbsp;fibre optic communications</li>
<li>Brandon, a graduate optical design engineer at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/careers/st-locations/emea/united_kingdom/edinburgh_scotland.html">STMicroelectronics</a></li>
<li>Darren, working in research and development at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.optoscribe.com/">Optoscribe&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>Emma, working in research and development at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/about/careers/st-locations/emea/united_kingdom/edinburgh_scotland.html">STMicroelectronics</a>&nbsp;<br>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The MSc course has provided a useful checklist for the problem-solving tasks I have faced at STMicroelectronics. By applying knowledge gained on the course to the challenges in a project, I have been able to use more thought through debug techniques, which in turn leads to a faster and more efficient solution." - Emma</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Nicholas, research engineer in the EngD programme working at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cap.fraunhofer.co.uk/">Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics</a><br>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The course covers a broad range of photonics topics in a lot of depth both in theory and practise, which gave me a really solid foundation to go on and do work in different areas with confidence. Additionally, the teaching staff and the programme itself are widely respected across both industry and academia, and a lot of previous graduates of the programme are well established in their careers now and know the value this course provides. I'm delighted to be doing a doctorate which I would definitely not be able to do without having done the POED MSc."- Nicholas</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Max, working in data science&nbsp;</li>
<li>Owen,EngD research engineer at&nbsp;<a href="https://research.eu.medical.canon/">Canon Medical Research Europe</a></li>
<li>Paddy,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uk.leonardocompany.com/">Leonardo's</a> graduate scheme&nbsp;</li>
<li>Paul, working for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uniklasers.com/">Unik Lasers</a></li>
<li>Rowan,&nbsp;EngD research engineer at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.optoscribe.com/">Optoscribe</a>&nbsp;<br>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The POED course was invaluable in teaching me the necessary theory and skills required for an exciting and varied career in photonics. The industrial placement was a particular highlight, giving first-hand experience in an industrial environment. For me, this led directly onto an EngD placement with the company. This involves four years of industrial research for the sponsor company, which concludes with producing a thesis for a doctorate degree. It is the industrial equivalent of a PhD. I would highly recommend both the POED course and EngD route to an industrial career in photonics." - Rowan</p>

<p align="left">Eight students graduated in November 2015 at the ceremony&nbsp;in St Andrews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Angelos is now working at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.m2lasers.com/">M-Squared Lasers</a>.</li>
<li>Christoph is employed as an Optical Engineer by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.st.com/web/en/home.html">STMicroelectronics</a>, where he had worked on his MSc project.</li>
<li>Dougie has started a PhD at the University of Durham in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/cfai/">Centre for Advanced Instrumentation</a>&nbsp;for Astronomy.</li>
<li>Shivani got a placement at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.selex-es.com/international-presence/uk/uk-locations">Selex</a>&nbsp;during her studies and now has a position in a different role at the same company.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The company summer placement project is something quite unique provided by this course and allows a taste of industrial experience to those who choose to work at a company. This was invaluable experience when deciding whether or not an engineering job was something I'd wish to consider in the future.&nbsp;Furthermore, it was interesting to be exposed to the research from two institutions renowned for their work done in the area of photonics."&nbsp;– Shivani</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Kim has started&nbsp;a PhD in Physics at Heriot-Watt University with the aim of developing new high-energy amplifiers for ultrafast laser pulses. This research project is within the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cim-laser.ac.uk/">EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Laser-based production processes</a>&nbsp;where she will be working with industry partner&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rofin-uk.com/">Rofin-Sinar UK</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Doing the MSc in Photonics and Optoelectronic Devices was the best choice I could have made. It is challenging and intensive, but most enjoyable and organised by two excellent universities, St Andrews and Heriot-Watt, both well-reputed in this research field and both maintaining a strong connection to industry. I personally worked in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.selex-es.com/international-presence/uk/uk-locations">Selex ES</a>&nbsp;for my final project which was a valuable experience. I would highly recommend this MSc program to everyone who is interested in photonics and would like to gain an insight into the photonics industry."&nbsp;– Kim</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mihail has joined the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mpl.mpg.de/en/sandoghdar/welcome.html">Sandoghdar division</a>&nbsp;at the Max Planck Institute for the science of light in Erlangen, Germany, to continue his studies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I conducted my research project at Heriot-Watt University under the supervision of&nbsp;Professor Daniele Faccio. The project was investigating the ability to image light-in-flight propagating through an optical crystal fibre using state-of-the-art single photon avalanche photo-diode arrays. The project was equally divided between experimental and theoretical work. The POED MSc combined with my previous BSc degree in Mathematical Physics had a big influence on my future career and led to the decision of conducting doctoral research incorporating both theoretical and experimental aspects."&nbsp;– Mihail</p>

<h4><strong>Calum Brown&nbsp;— five years after graduating in 2011</strong></h4>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8">
<blockquote>
<p>After completing the MSc, I spent two and half years working for a laser manufacturer, where my role was to build, test, ship and install the company’s principal laser system throughout the world. I was able to apply the knowledge and understanding gained throughout the MSc to an exciting and high-tech environment, practically and theoretically.</p>
<p>Since then, I have spent the last two years working for a surgical devices company in ophthalmology, testing, installing and providing technical support for surgeons and theatre staff in hospitals throughout Scotland. The MSc has been particularly helpful when working with the surgical refractive systems, where lasers are used to cut flaps in the cornea and reshape the cornea during corrective procedures.</p>
<p>The course in Photonics and Optoelectronic Devices was superb. As well as the chance to study at two world-leading universities, it has given me exciting, interesting and varied opportunities so far in my career.</p>
