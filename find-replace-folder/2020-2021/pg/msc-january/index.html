<li><strong>Action Research for Teachers:&nbsp;</strong>provides a learning experience in which you can reflect on concepts and theories you are studying in other modules and connect them with classroom practice. The module explores the combined value of reflection and action research for classroom practitioners, providing a means for language teachers to understand their classroom contexts and to plan responses to challenges in these contexts.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Language Teaching Methodology</strong>:&nbsp;explores the theories that inform teaching practice and analyses the implications these have in terms of ways of learning, material used, the teacher role and the learning spaces. This is essential for all those seeking to understand teaching environments more clearly and for those who have a chance to influence teaching environments.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Linguistics for Language Teachers</strong>: equips you with the skills required to describe and analyse language. It does not assume prior knowledge of Linguistics and seeks to introduce you to selected fundamental concepts, relevant to English language teaching. You acquire appropriate terminology and techniques in the analysis and description of grammatical terms and structures.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Second Language Acquisition</strong>: how do we learn languages? Does it make any difference what age we start at? Why do some learners seem to do better than others? Answers to these questions, and many more would be very useful to inform language teachers, and to guide learners. This module traces the development of SLA theory, considers language learning from the perspective of learners, their differences and the strategies they can use, and from the perspective of the teacher and SLA researcher in order to apply theory to practice.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Teaching and Researching</strong>:&nbsp;teachers are increasingly expected to be evidence-informed or even evidence-led; consuming, creating, and sharing research. This module addresses how we evaluate the quality of research to decide what is rigorous and informative for our practice, how we can build on existing research when planning our own interventions, and how to design, pilot and reflect on the effectiveness of different data collection instruments. We consider a range of research contexts and values to help you actively engage with pedagogical research.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>You will choose three optional modules from the following list, subject to timetabling restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assessment and Evaluation</strong>: brings together the study of language testing with the theory and practice of assessment in pedagogy. You will learn key concepts in both, how to design and improve tests for different purposes, and how to make productive use of assessment within teaching. We also consider some of the broader social impacts of assessment and testing and how teachers navigate tensions when promoting student learning within a measurement culture. The module also acts as an example of learning through assessment, giving you opportunities to reflect on how different approaches such as mastery learning or active learning are reflected in assessment design, as well as critiquing aspects of assessment such as the use of time limits, group tasks, multiple-choice questions, and gamification.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English Medium Instruction</strong>: in recent years there has been a rapid increase in the teaching of academic subjects through English in countries where the majority of the population do not use English as a first language. This module explores this global trend from the standpoint of content and language teachers, as well as students. It considers the wide variety of English Medium Instruction contexts, evaluating theory in an attempt to address some of the practical challenges involved.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>English for Academic Purposes</strong>: preparing and supporting students who come to study for undergraduate or postgraduate degrees through the medium of English is one of the most challenging but rewarding jobs in the field of language teaching. To do this well, an EAP teacher needs to understand the higher education context; the key principles underpinning learning in a university; text and discourse in the communities of the different disciplines, theories and practice of assessment; and the most effective methods and materials to motivate students and help them into a discourse community.&nbsp;<br><br></li>
<li><strong><strong><strong><strong>Teaching Young Learners</strong>: </strong></strong></strong>explores theories of child development and learning which are fundamental to the understanding of child second language acquisition,&nbsp;namely children aged 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to 18. Child psychology has to be taken into account in the development of teaching materials, teaching styles and classroom management. There is also a practical element to the module, as tutorials will involve the creation of materials and delivery to peers, who will take on the characteristics of the target students, in order to apply theory to practice.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Technology for Teaching</strong>:&nbsp;introduces you to the principle theories, concepts and practices&nbsp;of technology in language education. You&nbsp;will be able to critically consider the role and purpose of various modes of technology in education in a wide range of settings to identify and conceptualise problems within your own professional contexts.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>For the dissertation, you will choose a topic of interest to you and to your future career. You will read related literature and conduct independent research on your topic.The dissertation will be written during the second Semester 2.</p>
<p>Student dissertations will be supervised by IE staff members. Supervisors will provide guidance throughout the research process, helping you to formulate a suitable research hypothesis. They will offer advice&nbsp;on relevant literature and how to plan your time effectively.</p>

                <p>TESOL graduates are equipped with a range of skills and experiences which allow them to take on a variety of roles. The majority of TESOL students work within education, either as teachers or lecturers, as researchers, or as policymakers. Other graduates work in publishing, journalism and management.</p>
<p>Lecturers within the International Education Institute have a wealth of both teaching and leadership experience in TESOL, in a range of locations globally. They are active in using their international networks and experience to support and advise students on future career development. Current teaching staff have taught or held educational leadership roles in China, Finland, Hungary, Japan, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, UK, USA and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The University&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/careers/">Careers Centre</a>&nbsp;also offers one-to-one advice to all students on a taught postgraduate course and&nbsp;provides a programme of events to assist students&nbsp;in building their employability skills.</p>
