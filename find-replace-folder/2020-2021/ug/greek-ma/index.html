              <p>The MA (Hons) in Greek is a four-year course run by the School of Classics. &nbsp;In the first year, if you have not studied Greek previously, you will be introduced to Greek language and literature from scratch. If you have already studied Greek at a higher level, in your first year you will undertake more advanced study in language and literature in modules that integrate the study of literary texts with linguistic and translation exercises.</p>
<p>Alongside Greek, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually continue to study at least one of these subjects. Find out more about more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In second year, all students are brought together to take modules that extend and refine their knowledge of Greek literature and its background, covering both prose and poetry from the archaic to the imperial period, while continuing to incorporate progressive work on Greek language skills in preparation for Honours-level study. Extra support classes are provided for ex-beginners.</p>
<p>The skills you gain in analysing original Greek texts will prepare you for exploring an even wider range of texts at a more advanced level in your third and fourth years. You will also be encouraged to delve deeper into a specialist topic of your choice in writing a dissertation during your fourth year. All of the School’s Honours modules are inspired by the research expertise of the members of staff who teach them, and expose you to the latest debates and developments in the discipline. They cover a wide range of genres and themes. Topics may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greek poetry, including epic and tragedy</li>
<li>Greek historiography, including authors like Herodotus and Thucydides</li>
<li>Greek rhetoric</li>
<li>Greek philosophy</li>
<li>Greek literature in the Roman Empire</li>
<li>Greek prose composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>A wide choice of other modules is available to complement Greek and suit your interests. Popular choices include Classical Studies, Ancient History, English Literature, Modern Languages, Medieval and Modern History, Philosophy and Divinity.</p>
<p>Students wishing to study both Greek and Latin should consider choosing&nbsp;<a href="../classics-ma/index.html">Classics MA (Hons)</a>&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>Graduates in Greek from St&nbsp;Andrews can expect to have developed a wide knowledge of ancient Greek literature and culture and a high level of competence in Greek language.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teaching at sub-honours level is delivered through a mixture of lectures, seminars, language classes and set-text reading classes (10 to 30 students).</p>
<p>At Honours level, all teaching is delivered through seminars (10 to 20 students), with a strong emphasis on students’ own contributions in informal class discussion and in group or individual presentations.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom. &nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading Greek texts</li>
<li>practising language and translation skills</li>
<li>reading journal articles and books</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>working on individual projects</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Greek and Classics. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/people/">Greek staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of Classics website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Classics, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a></p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Almost all modules in Greek are assessed by a combination of coursework and examination. Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>research essays</li>
<li>literary criticism and commentary exercises</li>
<li>class tests, including unseen translation and grammar exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, most modules include a written examination held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Greek may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7240/">Bacchae Society</a>&nbsp;is the student society for everyone with an interest in all things classical.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6068/">Student Archaeological Society</a>&nbsp;holds regular meetings, covering both archaeological and classical topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Classics is housed in Swallowgate, an attractive building which overlooks the sea and is close to the University Library and St Salvator’s Quadrangle. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building.</p>
<p>The Swallowgate building also houses the School of Classics’ class library. The class&nbsp;library contains books that supplement the extensive holdings in the main Library and closely support the School’s undergraduate programmes. It is a lovely additional study space for students in the School.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
