                <p>The International Foundation programme for Medicine has been designed with the University's School of Medicine to develop your sciences and communication skills to prepare you for success in a degree in Medicine.</p>
<p>Central to the Medicine Foundation programme is an ethos of cooperation and collaboration amongst students, which is achieved through group work and projects in the context of a supportive environment for personal and academic growth. </p>
<p>You will be given personal tutorial slots each semester where you can discuss all aspects of academic work and life. Through these tutorials, you will learn how to adopt and develop positive mindsets and learning strategies in order to help you during the programme and your future degree.</p>
<p>English language teachers will work with you to develop your academic writing, your study techniques and your time-management skills.</p>
<p>Foundation programme classes integrate your science and English language learning through their focus on writing laboratory reports, structuring essays, critical thinking and scientific methods of investigation. In addition, you will practice doctor-patient interaction, including with simulated patients, and have opportunities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>consolidate your learning and attend a workshop to prepare for the multiple mini interviews (MMI) at a mansion in the Highlands of Scotland</li>
<li>volunteer with a local charity which provides support and companionship for the elderly and vulnerable in the local area</li>
<li>gain an accredited first-aid certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme enables international students to function effectively as undergraduates studying Medicine, enhancing their discipline-specific knowledge and skills, and developing critical thinking and reflection.</p>
<p>By the end of the programme students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate an overall appreciation of the body of philosophies related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate knowledge that is embedded in the main theories, concepts and principles of the philosophies related to the study of medicine and apply that knowledge in practical contexts</li>
<li>undertake critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis of ideas, concepts, information and issues that are within the common understandings of health and medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate awareness of own and others’ roles, responsibilities and contributions when carrying out and evaluating tasks related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>convey complex information to a range of audiences such as fellow students, medical professionals, and patients</li>
<li>exercise autonomy and initiative in some activities in their learning</li>
<li>manage, under guidance, ethical and professional issues in accordance with current professional codes related to the medical profession.</li>

                <p>Students are required to meet the following requirements in their assessments to&nbsp;successfully complete the International Foundation programme for Medicine. Results are graded on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/academicdatateam/assessmentandawards/gradingsheets/">University's 20-point scale</a>.</p>
<p>In order to progress onto the BSc Medicine (A100) at St Andrews, students must achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>an&nbsp;average grade of 11.0 or above for:
<ul>
<li>IFP Foundations for Medicine&nbsp;1</li>
<li>IFP Foundations for Medicine 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a&nbsp;grade of 11.0 or above for&nbsp;IFP Human Biology.</li>
<li>an grade of 12.0 or above&nbsp;at first sitting for:<br>
<ul>
<li>Introductory Inorganic and Physical Chemistry</li>
<li>Biology 1&nbsp;<strong>or</strong> Psychology 1 (September pathway)</li>
<li>Organic and Biological Chemistry 1&nbsp;<strong>or</strong>&nbsp;Psychology 2 (January and September pathway)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students must also meet the following entry requirements of the School of Medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>a competitive score in UCAT, achieved in the year of entry onto the International Foundation programme for Medicine. If this condition is not met, the competitive score on UCAT can also be achieved in the year of graduation from the International Foundation programme, prior to entry onto A100 BSc Medicine.</li>
<li>satisfactory performance on the&nbsp;multiple mini interviews with the School of Medicine</li>
<li>Applicants who use English as an additional language and who cannot provide their English language ability through their school-leaving qualifications must achieve 7 in all four components of the&nbsp;<wbr>International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) exam, to be taken at one sitting. This is irrespective of any other English qualification achieved. The final four consecutive years of secondary or&nbsp;<wbr>high school education in an English-medium school may in some cases be considered as evidence of English language ability. This will be considered on a case by case basis. IELTS scores have a&nbsp;<wbr>recommended two-year validity period, and this time limit will be applied.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<p>2019-2020 resits are not available for IFP modules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provided that&nbsp;you successfully complete the programme and you meet the above entry requirements for the School of Medicine at the University of St Andrews, you will be given an unconditional offer to enter&nbsp;first&nbsp;year of the BSc Medicine&nbsp;(A100).</p>
<p>Students who do not move on to Medicine but meet the academic requirements for the Faculty of Science, may be able to study a science degree (Biology, Chemistry or Psychology) at St&nbsp;Andrews, or to secure a place at another institution.&nbsp;Programme coordinators can assist with advice and UCAS applications as necessary to work towards the best possible outcome for you.</p>
