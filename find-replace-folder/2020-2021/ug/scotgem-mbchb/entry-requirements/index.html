		</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>Applicants are expected to demonstrate a range of personal attributes and experiences that are relevant to medicine. Information can be supplied in various forms: the UCAS reference, the UCAS personal statement and in a web-based questionnaire that will be sent to all applicants in October after the UCAS deadline. A candidate’s interest in ScotGEM and their reflections on work experience will form part of the discussions at interview.</p>
<h4><strong>Personal statement</strong></h4>
<p>The UCAS personal statement should demonstrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>a range of suitable personal attributes such as motivation, commitment, social contribution, teamwork and leadership, and excellent communication skills</li>
<li>an understanding of, and commitment to, medicine</li>
<li>achieved medically related work or shadowing experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reference</strong></h4>
<p>Applicants who&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;studied at university at any point in the past three years (for example, an undergraduate degree, a Masters or a PhD), will&nbsp;only<strong>&nbsp;</strong>need to provide an academic reference as part of the UCAS application. This can be from an academic tutor or advisor of studies. Your academic referee should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be up to date with your academic progress</li>
<li>have taught or supervised you in the last three years prior to entry to ScotGEM</li>
<li>comment on your academic performance, your attitude to study and your approach to working with others, including communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants who&nbsp;<strong>have not</strong>&nbsp;studied at university in the past&nbsp;three years&nbsp;will need to provide&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>&nbsp;of the following references as part of their UCAS applications. Any reference must be within the last three years.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>an academic reference (for example, Higher or A-Level). Your academic referee should:
<ul>
<li>be up-to-date with your academic progress</li>
<li>have taught or supervised you in the last three years prior to entry to ScotGEM</li>
<li>comment on your academic performance, your attitude to study and your approach to working with others, including communication skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a workplace&nbsp;reference. Your workplace referee should:
<ul>
<li>comment on your suitability for medicine</li>
<li>have managed or supervised you in the last three years prior to entry to ScotGEM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All applicants&nbsp;should note:</p>
<ul>
<li>References from family members or close friends are&nbsp;not&nbsp;acceptable.</li>
<li>Academic references must come from an official higher education institution email account.</li>
<li>Workplace references must come from an official work email account.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Web-based questionnaire</strong></h4>
<p>The web-based questionnaire will allow candidates to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explain why they are particularly interested in or suited to ScotGEM</li>
<li>give details about their medically related work experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Work experience</strong></h4>
<p>Before applying to ScotGEM, applicants should have had work experience in a health situation with people who may be ill, disabled, elderly or by shadowing a doctor at work. The main aim of work experience is to gain insight into health and healthcare delivery and to allow candidates to make an informed choice before deciding to apply to study medicine.</p>
<p>ScotGEM does not credit the volume of work experience and discourages applicants seeking to acquire experience in excess of two weeks. The programme also does not encourage work experience in resource-poor settings where candidates may be exposed to risk or take up scarce staff time. Medically related work experience is not ‘scored’ but instead forms part of the discussions at interview.</p>
<p>ScotGEM&nbsp;reserves the right to require applicants to provide details regarding activities described on UCAS personal statements or the web-based questionnaire (such as contacts regarding work experience) and will investigate a number at random as well as any suspect claims. Misleading statements may lead to an application being rejected.</p>
<h4><strong>Commitment</strong></h4>
<p>Medicine is a profession that requires commitment. It is important that the choice to enter medicine is made with insight into where it might lead, the role of life-long learning, and with awareness that the course trains for professional practice.<br><br>In considering the commitment involved in becoming a doctor, the following web pages provide important guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.medschools.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx">Medical Schools Council</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/">General Medical Council</a></li>

			<button class="accordion-item__toggle-button" aria-controls="">Disability</button>
		</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>A disability need not be a barrier to becoming a doctor. Applicants who have a disability will need to consider what effect that disability could have on patients and colleagues and how it would impact on their&nbsp;capacity to function as a medical practitioner in an effective and safe manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>It is important that disabilities and health conditions are declared at the time of application so that any reasonable adjustments required can be put in place by the time of entry to the medicine course.</p>

	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>It is important that the choice to enter medicine is made with insight into where it might lead, the role of life-long learning, and with awareness that the course is a training for professional practise.</p>
<p>Medical students are expected to behave with the utmost integrity from the very start of their training. It is therefore essential that you are able to fulfil&nbsp;<strong>fitness to practise </strong>criteria<strong>&nbsp;</strong>requirements based on the General Medical Council’s publication of Good Medical Practice, incorporating the points outlined in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/duties_of_a_doctor.asp" target="duties">duties of a doctor</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of each year, ScotGEM students will be required to submit a signed ScotGEM student contract which indicates what is expected of professionals in training, and this includes giving consent to being filmed as part of their training in clinical medicine. If a student’s conduct falls below acceptable standards, this could lead to a student being referred to a ‘fitness to practise’ committee. The ScotGEM student contract is available to offer holders, in draft form, through Launchpad (online orientation which will be&nbsp;emailed to offer holders).</p></div>

		</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>Applicants to Medical degree courses at the University are required to declare any criminal involvement on application. Applications from students who have declared a criminal conviction are subject to the same academic selection process as all applications and will be assessed using the admissions process outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/policy/">University&rsquo;s admissions&nbsp;policy</a>.</p>
<p>Entrants to Medicine will also be required to undertake satisfactory&nbsp;<strong>criminal record screening</strong>&nbsp;as part of the non-academic conditions of their offer. This involves joining the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mygov.scot/pvg-scheme/?via=https://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/faq/">Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) Scheme</a>. The scheme provides the applicant and the University with a live update of the person's fitness to work with regulated adults or children. In addition, students will be asked to declare any minor historical offences, warnings or cautions as well as any which are still pending.</p>
<p>For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="http://medhandbook.st-andrews.ac.uk/blog/pvg-scheme/">PVG guidance</a>&nbsp;or contact the ScotGEM office by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:scotgem-admin@st-andrews.ac.uk">scotgem-admin@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.</p></div>

	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>Entrants to Medicine will be subject to an occupational health check which&nbsp;includes a pre-entry questionnaire and screening.</p>
<p>Entrants will be screened for tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infection. All entrants are required to complete a course of immunisation against hepatitis B virus. Guidance is available to offer holders through Launchpad (an online orientation which will be&nbsp;emailed to offer holders).</p>
<p>Infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV does not mean that training to be a doctor is impossible, but applicants should consider at this stage whether or not this is the career option that they wish to pursue. Any entrant student who is found to be a carrier of hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV will require counselling as such a situation may place restrictions on the student's clinical training or practice following qualification. Applicants who have had an infection of this nature and wish to discuss this further before making a decision should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:medsupport@st-andrews.ac.uk">medsupport@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If a student is found to have deliberately failed to disclose information that could have made him or her ineligible to study medicine, or given false information, the course provider can consider removing them from training on grounds of dishonesty.</p></div>
