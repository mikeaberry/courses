              <p>The BSc in Ecology and Conservation is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. The programme begins with a broad foundation&nbsp;in Biology and then progresses to ecology and evolution with options across a range of relevant topics. It incorporates substantial practical and field training, and development of quantitative skills.</p>
<p>Alongside Biology, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules that allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, inquiry-based learning.</p>
<p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.</p>
<p>These facilities include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>&nbsp;houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
<li><a href="http://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/cbd/">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>&nbsp;has excellent facilities for behavioural, ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>&nbsp;offers large multi-group laboratories focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology and molecular medicine.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. Find out more about <a href="direct/index.html">direct entry to second year</a>&nbsp;for Ecology and Conservation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Field trips</h3>
<p>From first year to Honours, students studying Biology will also have the opportunity to go on field trips to gather data. Those who have a particular interest in ecology or marine biology will be perfectly located in St&nbsp;Andrews on the shores of the east coast.</p>
<p>During third year, Ecology and Conservation students will participate in a week-long field course involving field-based exercises in a range of aquatic or terrestrial habitats. You will be able to examine and measure biodiversity, ecophysiological adaptation and community structure with both plant and animal materials.</p>
<p>In Honours years, students can explore further afield in places such as Indonesia and Antarctica.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>The BSc in Ecology and Conservation is taught through a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>practical classes</li>
<li>field work</li>
<li>research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical class sizes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: lectures 240 to 270, practicals 80 to 90 students</li>
<li>Second year: lectures 80 to 120, practicals 40 to 60&nbsp;students</li>
<li>Third year: lectures 20 to 60, practicals 20 to 60&nbsp;students</li>
<li>Fourth year: 5 to 20&nbsp;students</li>
</ul>
<p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a modern biologist. Each student is provided with teaching microscopes and is taught in state-of-the-art teaching laboratories. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
<p>Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of biology, ecology and conservation. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Biology, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.</p>
<p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations. In fourth year, some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet, and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <strong><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;</strong>and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/2019-20/list.html?v=ug">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Ecology and Conservation students may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>&nbsp;organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6978/">Wildlife and Conservation Society</a>&nbsp;is committed to promoting wildlife conservation among the student body through campaigns and events, including documentary film screenings, walks and festivals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Biology students have lectures and practicals in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/">JF Allen Science Library</a>.One other area available for Biology students is the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/museum/bellpettigrew/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a>&nbsp;in the Bute building, a spectacular zoology museum which includes an arrangement of species to show the evolutionary and taxonomic relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
