<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>During your degree, you will cover topics and issues including:</p>
<ul>
<li>international security</li>
<li>world trade and finance</li>
<li>environmental politics</li>
<li>human rights</li>
<li>terrorism</li>
<li>regional and ethnic conflict</li>
<li>impact of globalisation.</li>
</ul>

              <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>Both St&nbsp;Andrews and William &amp; Mary offer a broad interdisciplinary approach to understanding global and international politics. At St&nbsp;Andrews, students select two-thirds of their sub-honours modules outside core IR topics. At William &amp; Mary, the programme covers modules from at least three departments: Government, Economics and History.</p>
<p>In their Honours years, students specialise in areas and topics in international politics that are of interest to them. These elective modules — covering all major world regions, trade, security, foreign policy, peace and conflict studies, international organisations, etc — are offered in a small class setting where students learn from experts researching on the topics they teach.</p>
<p>Both programmes also have their unique strengths, allowing students to design a truly unparalleled programme which builds on the specifics of North American and British approaches to International Relations. Studying at William &amp; Mary incorporates strong methodological training, while St&nbsp;Andrews’ strengths in international political theory and critical approaches encourage students to question their own assumptions about the world we live in.</p>

This independent project enables you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The compulsory modules listed here must be taken in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours-level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules available for the current academic year can be found in <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">the module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

<p>Research-led teaching brings cutting-edge research directly to the classroom in St&nbsp;Andrews.</p>
<p>Students at St&nbsp;Andrews for their first or second year will have three lectures a week per module (approximately 365 students), which decreases to one lecture per module per week at Honours level (15 to 25 students).</p>
<p>Lectures are supported by weekly small group tutorials&nbsp;(10 to 15 students) to discuss the material covered in lectures.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures and tutorials, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. &nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>At St&nbsp;Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of International Relations. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/ir/people/">International Relations staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of International Relations website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules in International Relations at St&nbsp;Andrews are assessed by a mixture of coursework and written exams. Some modules have only written essays rather than final exams.</p>
<p>Coursework takes the form of essays, along with other kinds of assessed work including oral presentations and group projects.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of International Relations may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6628/">Model United Nations</a>&nbsp;runs a programme of events throughout the year, culminating in a conference with nearly 700 international delegates.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6362/">The Foreign Affairs Society</a>&nbsp;is a diverse and dynamic society that encourages the St&nbsp;Andrews community to explore global politics and current affairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>International Relations at St&nbsp;Andrews is housed in the Arts Building, which is centrally located right next to the University library. Students will primarily attend lectures here, but may go to other buildings around St&nbsp;Andrews for larger lectures.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
