              <p>The BSc&nbsp;in Physics is a four-year course run by the School of Physics and Astronomy. During your degree, you will be introduced to core topics in mainstream physics – such as mechanics, special relativity, waves, quantum physics, light, electricity and magnetism – as well as develop the necessary mathematical, computational, and laboratory skills needed as a physicist. Later in the course, these underpinning skills and knowledge bases may be used to explain and explore a range of contemporary topics.</p>
<p>In the first two years of your studies you will also study modules from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, as mathematics is the language of physics. Depending on how many mathematics modules you choose to do, you may be able to choose modules in other subjects such as astronomy, chemistry, computer science, philosophy, or many other subjects from across the University. The flexible nature of the degree programmes at St Andrews means that by appropriate choice of modules in first and second year, you may be able to change your final degree topic during your course. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>You have some choice of modules in first and second year. At the start of third year, your choice of degree title (in the School of Physics and Astronomy) largely determines what set of modules you take in third year. There is significant choice of modules in fourth year.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school and college leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. This allows them to complete their degree programme in three years instead of four. Find out more about <a href="direct/index.html">direct entry to second year for Physics BSc</a>.</p>
<p>It is possible for students to take Physics as a five-year Integrated Masters course in&nbsp;<a href="../physics-mphys/index.html">Physics</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../theoretical-physics-mphys/index.html">Theoretical Physics</a>&nbsp;or <a href="../astrophysics-mphys/index.html">Astrophysics</a> allowing you to graduate with a Master of Physics. Direct entry into second year for these courses is also possible, allowing you to complete an Integrated Masters degree programme in four years instead of five.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits.

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Physics modules are taught through a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and laboratory work.</p>
<p>In both first and second year, each core Physics module typically consists of four to five lectures per week (around 20 to 150 students), along with one problem-solving workshop, one small group tutorial (4 to 8 students), and 2.5 hours in the teaching laboratory. Laboratory work is usually undertaken in pairs in first year and individually in second year.</p>
<p>At Honours level, lecture-based modules in this School typically consist of three lectures per week (5 to 100 students), some with associated small group tutorials (5 to 9 students). Students on the Physics BSc also take two laboratory based modules, each of which runs two afternoons a week in different semesters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your final semester, you will spend around 20 hours per week focusing on your final project.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library or online</li>
<li>preparing for laboratory work</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Physics, and will have significant interaction with staff within the School. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/">contact information for all Physics staff</a> on the School of Physics and Astronomy website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Physics and Astronomy, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, most modules are assessed by a mix of coursework and written examinations. In Honours years, assessment depends on the nature of the specific module. Most modules give a higher weighting to written examinations, but some are assessed solely through coursework.</p>
<p>Coursework includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>laboratory work</li>
<li>classroom tests</li>
<li>presentations</li>
<li>reviews of research papers</li>
<li>tutorial participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within a time specified for the assignment, in some cases two days, in some cases two weeks. Feedback is given with a view to improving your performance in the future.</p>
<p>Undergraduates on the BSc in Physics&nbsp;can find information on progressing through the degree in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs">Physics&nbsp;programme requirements</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students come from across Scotland, across the UK, and around the world to join an international community of students and staff, and all join the University from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>The relatively small size of the town means that students get to meet easily with many other students. Some of the optional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/why/life/traditions/">student traditions</a>&nbsp;help with this mixing. Most entrant students live in University-managed accommodation. There are over 150 student societies and sports clubs to choose from. This can all help to ensure a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students of Physics may be interested in joining the following student academic societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6089/">Astronomy Society</a>&nbsp;(Astrosoc) runs a range of events from stargazing to an annual ball.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7307/">Physics Society</a>&nbsp;(PhySoc) promotes the understanding and enjoyment of physics. PhySoc hosts a number of events including lectures, an annual ball, day trips and pub nights.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6600/">Mathematical Society</a>&nbsp;(SUMS) organises talks on mathematics as well as lunchtime gatherings and pub nights.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Physics and Astronomy is situated in a modern building located on the western edge of the town. Most teaching is conducted in this building, which includes a library (with two group study rooms) as well as computing and research facilities specifically for the use of Astrophysics and Physics students.</p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As the campus is located around town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</p>

<h4>Curriculum development</h4>
<p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a class="js-ga-track" href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/course-revision-protocol.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>&nbsp;<acronym>(PDF, 72 KB)</acronym>.</p>
<h4>Tuition fees</h4>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a class="js-ga-track" href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/fee-setting-protocol.pdf">The University’s approach to fee setting is described online</a>&nbsp;<acronym>(PDF, 84 KB)</acronym>.</p>
