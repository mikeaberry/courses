              <p>The MSci (Hons) in Computer Science is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Computer Science. &nbsp;The course is designed to ground you in both the theory and practice of computer science. You will learn to think and solve problems logically, understand the fundamental principles of how computing systems work, and be exposed to significant new technologies as well as teamwork.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will learn the basic concepts behind computer science and several different programming languages.</p>
<p>Alongside Computer Science, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study at least one additional subject. In the second year, you can continue with this other subject or focus entirely on Computer Science. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/ug/options/routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, you will be introduced to Turing machines, non-determinism and pushdown automata, followed by study of decidability, simulation and the Halting problem.</p>
<p>The foundations of logic that are relevant to computer scientists will also be covered, with an emphasis on automatic reasoning and decidability, including propositional and predicate calculus, various proof techniques and Goedel’s incompleteness theorem.</p>
<p>You will apply software engineering concepts and practices to a substantial software engineering project as part of a team. This project runs through both semesters in third year and will prepare you for the workplace, where collaboration with others is essential.</p>
<p>In fourth year, you will choose options from Honours and Masters-level classes. In fifth year, you will spend one semester of your final year dedicated to undertaking a major software engineering or research project under the guidance of an individual supervisor. You will also be able to take a number of modules at Masters level, providing advanced training in computer science. Topics may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>language and computation</li>
<li>software engineering practice</li>
<li>critical systems engineering</li>
<li>software architecture</li>
<li>human computer interaction principles and methods</li>
<li>interactive software and hardware</li>
<li>data-intensive systems</li>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>data ethics and privacy</li>
<li>information visualisation.</li>

<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reading party</h3>
<p>All Honours students have the opportunity to attend a reading party in their third year. The reading party takes place in a large country house in the Highlands where students will spend three days giving presentations, taking part in outdoor and indoor activities, and socialising with peers and staff.</p>

                <h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>Computer Science at St&nbsp;Andrews allows you to study in a friendly and intimate environment. Small group teaching will put you on a first-name  basis with internationally renowned researchers and teachers.</p>
<p>Computer Science classes are taught using a variety of teaching methods in addition to traditional lectures, with an emphasis on personal and small-group teaching.</p>
<p>Typical class sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: lectures 72 to 170, labs up to 100, tutorials 6 to 7</li>
<li>Second year: lectures 70 to 104, labs up to 100, tutorials 6 to 7</li>
<li>Honours: lectures, labs and tutorials 9 to 125.</li>
</ul>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and computer labs, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. &nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>using library and online resources</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Computer Science. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials and demonstrations in laboratory classes, as well as assessment of coursework, under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/directory">contact information for all Computer Science staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of Computer Science website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Computer Science, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Assessment</h3>
<p>Most Computer Science modules are assessed by at least 40% with the rest of assessment in the form of written examinations. Project modules are assessed entirely by coursework.</p>
<p>The School uses a range of forms of assessment for the coursework component. For example, these could include programming assignments and projects, design exercises, essays, and problem sheets.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Computer Science may be interested in joining the following student societies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6236/">Computing Society</a> (STACS) provides a social group for people interested in computers or who are looking to undertake projects involving computing. Events include hackathons, talks on computer topics, and socials.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6383/">Gaming Society</a> meets regularly to play and discuss a variety of video games, ranging from retro and handhelds to modern PC and console gaming.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/7199/">Saints Engineering Group</a> promotes the development of engineering skills for STEM fields and completes yearly engineering projects, some of which involve developing software and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Computer Science is situated in the Jack Cole and John Honey buildings on the western edge of town, and most lectures and tutorials will take place here. The buildings host both traditional lecture theatres as well as specialised rooms equipped with computer workstations. As a student, you will have all-hours access to teaching labs which provide a vibrant environment that supports individual and group work.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
