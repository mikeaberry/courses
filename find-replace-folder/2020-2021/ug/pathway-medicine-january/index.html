  <p>The Pathway to Medicine (January intake) is a two-phase programme that provides a route onto the Medicine degree at the University of St Andrews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Phase 1, students combine science modules with English language skills, a clinical observation project and UCAT preparation. In Phase 2, students focus on the study of Medicine and the communication skills and knowledge of ethics&nbsp;required for clinical practice. Phase 2 follows the structure of the International Foundation programme for Medicine.</p>
<p>The programme aims to develop scientific knowledge to prepare students for their study of Medicine, as well as provide students with the linguistic foundation appropriate for the demands of medical study.</p>

<p><strong>Semester 1 of Phase 1 (January to May 2020)</strong><br>All students will study&nbsp;three modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spoken communication in academic contexts 1:&nbsp;</strong>learn how to communicate effectively in a number of spoken academic contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Academic writing: </strong>aims to&nbsp;explore a range of academic functions, features of academic style and organisation, and academic grammar and vocabulary in order to improve students' overall academic literacy.</li>
<li><strong>Science modules:</strong> students focus on two science subjects.
<ul>
<li><strong>Organic and Biological Chemistry 1:</strong>&nbsp;includes lectures on the structure, stereochemistry and nomenclature of simple organic compounds, fundamental organic reaction mechanisms, organic functional groups and their reactions, introductory bioorganic chemistry, and organic spectroscopy.</li>
<li><strong>Physiology:</strong> introduces the students to how the human body functions in systems. Students look at how these systems are built from the molecular and cellular perspective along with tissues and organs. This allows students to appreciate how the body systems are maintained and controlled in normal and adverse conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Semester 2 of Phase 1 (June to August 2020)</strong><br>All students will study&nbsp;three modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Spoken communication in academic contexts 2:</strong></strong>&nbsp;students will develop their presentation skills, which will be essential for their academic careers and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Writing for Medicine</strong>: introduces students to&nbsp;the similarities and differences between reflective writing and other forms of academic writing. This will be useful for the reflective clinical report.</li>
<li><strong>Science modules:</strong>&nbsp;students focus on two science subjects.
<ul>
<li><strong>I<strong>ntroduction to Physical and Inorganic Chemistry:</strong> </strong>students develop their existing knowledge and understanding of patterns in the periodic table, structure and bonding in elements and compounds, reaction kinetics, equilibria and acid base chemistry, redox reactions and electrochemical cells, and chemical calculations using the mole concept.</li>
<li><strong>Physiology</strong>: expands on knowledge acquired in Semester 1 of Phase 1 of the Physiology module.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Clinical observation project</strong><br>Students complete a clinical observation project, usually in their home country. The key purpose of the project is to enhance your understanding of the skills, qualities, practices and systems of care settings. This will prepare you for Phase 2 of the Pathway to Medicine where there will be a much greater focus on what is required to study and practice Medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project takes place in a care facility which you will organise in a location most convenient for you. You will complete a reflective task as part of the project. The project must be submitted online on&nbsp;Monday 10&nbsp;August 2020, before the end of Phase 1.</p>
<p>By the end of Phase 1 students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate an overall appreciation of the body of knowledge of sciences required to study Medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate an understanding of differences between explanations based on evidence, research and other sources, and the importance of this difference in the study of sciences and medicine</li>
<li>present and evaluate arguments, information and ideas that are routine to science and medicine and more general contexts</li>
<li>select and use standard ICT applications to process, obtain and combine information for presentation of assessed and non-assessed work</li>
<li>understand a wider range of demanding, long texts related to science, medicine, and society, and recognise implicit meaning</li>
<li>use language flexibly and effectively for social and academic purposes.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Phase 2 takes place from&nbsp;September 2020 to May 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Semester 1 of Phase 2 (September to December 2020)</strong><br>In Semester 1 of Phase 2, students take modules in Chemistry and&nbsp;Biology.

<li><strong>Introductory Inorganic and Physical Chemistry:</strong>&nbsp;covers the origin of the elements, atoms and the Periodic Table, shapes and properties of molecules, chemistry of the elements, properties of solutions, thermochemistry, thermodynamics and kinetics.</li>
<li><strong>Biology 1:</strong>&nbsp;introduces students to molecular and cellular biology. It covers cell diversity and the origins of life, cellular structures and fundamental processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Semester 2 of Phase 2 (January to May 2021)</strong><br>Students must take the following compulsory modules in Semester 2 of Phase 2:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs)</strong><br>To prepare for the MMIs held by the School of Medicine in Semester 2, there will be workshops on the various interview stations so that students can develop their interview skills and MMI performance. Students also study medical ethics in order to transition into first-year medicine with an understanding of how medical ethics link to clinical practice and medical professionalism.</p>
<p>By the end of Phase 2 students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate an overall appreciation of the body of philosophies related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate knowledge that is embedded in the main theories, concepts and principles of the philosophies related to the study of medicine and apply that knowledge in practical contexts</li>
<li>undertake critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis of ideas, concepts, information and issues that are within the common understandings of health and medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate awareness of own and others’ roles, responsibilities and contributions when carrying out and evaluating tasks related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>convey complex information to a range of audiences such as fellow students, medical professionals, and patients</li>
<li>exercise autonomy and initiative in some activities in their learning</li>
<li>manage, under guidance, ethical and professional issues in accordance with current professional codes related to the medical profession.</li>
