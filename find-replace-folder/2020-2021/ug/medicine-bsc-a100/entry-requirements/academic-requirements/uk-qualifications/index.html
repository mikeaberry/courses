<li>Standard entry grades: AAAAB in S5. Predicted to achieve at least BBB in Highers or Advanced Highers or a mix&nbsp;of Highers and Advanced Highers in S6.</li>
<li>Minimum entry grades:&nbsp;AAABB in S5.&nbsp;Predicted to achieve at least BB in Highers or Advanced Highers or a mix&nbsp;of Highers and Advanced Highers in S6.</li>
<li>Gateway to Medicine: BBBB in Highers in S5</li>
</ul>
<p>Highers must include Chemistry and one of Biology (or Human Biology), Mathematics or Physics, to be taken at the same sitting. If not passed at Highers, applicants must also have National 5 grade B in Biology (or Human Biology), Mathematics, and English.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find out more about Standard, Minimum and Gateway entry requirements using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/academic-entry-explained/"><strong>academic entry explained</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;see which entry requirements you need to look at using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/indicator"><strong>entry requirements indicator</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>For applicants to Medicine to be considered with the Minimum entry requirements, they would need to be assessed as:</p>
<ul>
<li>residing in the lowest 40% most deprived areas of the UK&nbsp;<br><strong>or</strong></li>
<li>being looked after as a result of a local authority order. See information on <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/apply/care-experienced/">care experienced applicants</a>.&nbsp;<br><strong>or</strong></li>
<li>being registered as a young carer. See information on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/apply/young-carers/">young carers</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<p>Applicants should also note the following entry exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher qualifications should normally be obtained at the same sitting in S5. Exceptions may be made for candidates who attend schools which are unable to present pupils for five Highers at one sitting.</li>
<li>If Biology, Mathematics and English have not been passed at Higher grade, each must normally have been passed at National 5 grade B.</li>
<li>Human Biology may replace Biology.</li>
<li>A Higher in Intensive English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) is not acceptable as one of 5 Highers required at one sitting or as one of the subjects to be counted for S6 performance.</li>
<li>Students not taking the required sciences or mathematics in S5 may take the missing subjects in S6. Two science subjects must be sat in the same year (to include Chemistry) – either S5 or S6.</li>
<li>A mix of Highers and Advanced Highers in S5 would be considered.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Offers made will be conditional and based on S6 programmes of study.</li>
<li>Advanced Highers, new Highers, or a mix of Advanced Highers and new Highers would be acceptable for S6 study.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An applicant’s referee should include predicted grades for S6 in the application.</li>
<li>An A grade at Higher or Advanced Higher would not balance out a C grade in another subject.</li>
<li>Applicants sitting a single Higher earlier than S5 gain no advantage in&nbsp;the School's admissions assessment.</li>
<li>Applicants sitting&nbsp;six Highers in S5, as opposed to five Highers, gain no advantage in&nbsp;the School's admissions assessment.</li>
<li>Applicants sitting the Scottish Baccalaureate gain no advantage in&nbsp;the School's admissions assessment, other than for the Advanced Highers associated with it. However, the development of research skills will be useful for entrants to&nbsp;the course.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Over and above the subjects required for entry,&nbsp;the School does not have a preference for other subjects in S5 or S6; applicants should choose subjects they are interested in or will do well in.</li>

	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p><span lang="EN">Applicants who already hold an undergraduate degree that <strong>is no more than five years&nbsp;</strong>old may apply to study Medicine at undergraduate level.</span></p>
<p>To be considered for interview, applicants must have achieved (or be predicted to achieve) the following grades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper second or first class Honours degree in Science (or equivalent) to have been obtained within the last five years.</li>
<li>B&nbsp;grade in Chemistry at Higher or A-Level, or at Advanced Higher.</li>
<li>B grade in Biology, English and Mathematics at GCSE or equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guidance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants whose degree is more than five years old will not be considered. Further study (except for a PhD) will not be considered for a degree that is more than five years old.</li>
<li>A lower second class Honours degree followed by a second degree (first or upper second class Honours, Masters or PhD) will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Those who have previously studied on undergraduate Medicine degree programmes will not be considered.</li>
<li>Applicants can re-sit Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology and English qualifications to achieve the required grade(s) if not achieved at the time of leaving school.</li>
<li>Examples of qualifications/study that might be accepted in lieu of Higher/Advanced Higher/A level Chemistry:
<ul>
<li>20 credits of undergraduate level Chemistry at high grades.</li>
<li><em>Modules of mixed science (e.g. Biochemistry) are not accepted – modules must be pure Chemistry.</em></li>
<li>Open University – Chemistry:essential concepts module S215 – 60% or above.</li>
<li>SAT Chemistry – 700+</li>
<li>University of Glasgow – Access to Science, Engineering and Nursing: Chemistry ADED11406E – grade B.</li>
<li><em>Other access courses and HNC qualifications are not accepted as they do not offer enough Chemistry.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Entry requirements would be the same for both Scottish/EU/RUK and those who are ‘Overseas’ for fee purposes.</li>
<li>A GPA of 3.5 is considered to be the equivalent of an upper second class Honours degree. For advice with regard to degree classifications from other countries, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sturecruit@st-andrews.ac.uk">sturecruit@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>.</li>
<li>A reference from your university tutor commenting on your academic performance and suitability for medicine should be part of your UCAS application. If you have not yet achieved your degree, the reference should include a predicted degree classification.</li>
<li>A university transcript of academic performance should be forwarded to the Admissions Office as supplementary information. Graduates need to supply an academic transcript of their performance at university at the time of application. Those who will be graduating should, at the time of application, supply details of undergraduate courses taken and grades obtained so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please also see the&nbsp;four-year ScotGEM graduate entry programme.</p></div>

	<div class="accordion-item__content" id="" aria-hidden="true"><p>Undergraduates on courses other than Medicine who are in first year of an undergraduate programme will be considered if they have fulfilled the School's academic entry requirements before they began their undergraduate course. They must apply by the deadline of 15 October (first semester of first undergraduate year) and have sat the UCAT that year.</p>
<p>The School will not consider applicants who have progressed to second year. Meeting minimum entry requirements will not guarantee an offer – grades will have to be competitive with grades of all those applying at the same time. No credit for the undergraduate year is given as all entrants must&nbsp;complete the full six years of the medical degree. Graduates (or those soon to graduate) should see the graduate entry section above.</p>
<h4><strong>Undergraduates on Medicine courses</strong></h4>
<p>Those who are already on, or have been on, an undergraduate Medicine degree programme elsewhere will not be considered.</p></div>
