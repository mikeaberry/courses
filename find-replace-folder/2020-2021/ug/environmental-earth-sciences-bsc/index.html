              <p>The BSc (Hons) in Environmental Earth Sciences is a four-year course run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. During your degree, you will be able to take advantage of hands-on field and laboratory-based research projects that investigate topics as varied as the isotopic signals preserved in ancient rocks to recent sediments and what they record about conditions at the time of their formation, to the impact of volcanoes on climate.</p>
<p>In first year, you will be introduced to the main concepts of Earth system science, including Earth structure and Earth history, the evolution of life and the Earth’s biosphere, as well as contemporary processes that shape the planet’s surface and impact the living envelope.</p>
<p>Alongside Environmental Earth Sciences, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>In second year, modules provide additional and deeper study into climatology, mineralogy, sedimentary systems, earth surface processes, palaeontology, geophysics and geochemistry.</p>
<p>At Honours level, there is a shift from broad-themed modules to more specialised ones that introduce students to a wide variety of exciting new research trends and findings. Modules involve the opportunity to get first-hand experience of new research discoveries and advances in Earth Science by staff in an integrated lecture-lab-field forum.</p>
<p>Advanced topics available at Honours level include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>GIS (geographic information systems)&nbsp;for earth science</li>
<li>Data visualisation and statistics using R-Studio and Python</li>
<li>the study of global biogeochemical cycles</li>
<li>global climate change</li>
<li>sedimentary systems</li>
<li>isotope geochemistry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School is home to state-of-the-art analytical facilities supported by full-time technicians. These allow for the detailed characterisation of natural and synthetic materials, culturing of micro and macro organisms in extreme environments, and geological and geophysical field deployment. These facilities will enable you to address questions from fundamental field geology and to assess anthropological versus natural processes in driving environmental change. <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/research">Find out more about research facilities</a>.</p>
<p>As you advance in your degree, you are given more flexibility to choose your focus of study, whether that be in geochemistry or global biogeochemical cycles.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">flexible degree structure web page</a>.</p>
<h3>Fieldwork</h3>
<p>All students have the opportunity to obtain fieldwork skills via numerous day and multi-week-long field trips associated with individual modules, as well as up to four weeks of fieldwork associated with their independent research projects.</p>
<p>Examples of field trips that are part of the BSc Environmental Earth Sciences degree include:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: the five-day “Highland Fling” to renowned geological sites in the Scottish Highlands.</li>
<li>Second year:&nbsp;five days exploring the varying sources of iron, nitrate and phosphate levels on river systems in Yorkshire and their impact on pH and invertebrate life.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Third year: six days in Rio Tinto investigating the geochemistry and geobiology of acid mine drainage in southern Spain.</li>
<li>Fourth year: a five-day West Coast cruise exploring oceanography, marine biology, and sedimentology on a research vessel on Scotland’s beautiful West Coast.</li>
</ul>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations including short questions and essays.</p>
<p>At Honours level some modules are assessed through coursework (50%) and a final examination (50%), and other modules are based entirely on coursework.</p>
<p>The Honours dissertation is assessed through a written dissertation, project proposal and presentation.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>.

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students in the School may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6397/">Geological Society</a>, which organises activities such as lectures and networking events as well as social events and field trips across Britain.</p>
<p>The School of Earth and Environmental Sciences is housed within the Irvine Building in the historical heart of the University between St Salvator's Quadrangle and St Salvator's Hall. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building and in designated lecture theatres elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
