              <p>The MGeol (Hons) in Earth Sciences is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. &nbsp;The MGeol degree is designed to give you advanced experience prior to undertaking full-time employment or PhD research.</p>
<p>During your degree, you will be able to take advantage of hands-on field and laboratory-based research projects that investigate how Earth’s surface became oxygenated, planetary formation, and how the composition of the oceans and atmosphere have changed through time and their influence on the regulation of climate.</p>
<p>Alongside Earth Sciences, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year, you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you advance in your degree, you are given more flexibility to choose your focus of study, whether that be in geological mapping, geochemistry, global biogeochemical cycles or climatology.</p>
<p>MGeol students have the chance to engage in either an internship with industry or a placement within a research group. &nbsp;as well as the option to take part in a self-organised and planned geological expedition during their degree. In both instances, these would be arranged in consultation with the course and module coordinators.</p>
<h3>Fieldwork</h3>
<p>All students have the opportunity to obtain fieldwork skills via numerous day and multi-week-long field trips associated with individual modules, as well as up to four weeks of fieldwork associated with their independent research projects.</p>
<p>Examples of the field trips that are part of the MGeol in Earth Sciences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>five-day “Highland Fling” to renowned geological sites in the Scottish Highlands during first-year studies</li>
<li>six days exploring the varying sources of iron, nitrate and phosphate level in river systems in Yorkshire and their impact on pH and invertebrate life</li>
<li>six days of geological mapping in central Spain examining the polyphase Hercynian and Alpine orogenic belts during second-year studies</li>
<li>six days in Rio Tinto investigating the geochemistry and geobiology of acid mine drainage in southern Spain</li>
<li>twelve days of mapping the iconic Moine Thrust system and Caledonian igneous complexes in the Scottish Highlands&nbsp;during third-year studies</li>
<li>a two-week transect of the Alpine orogenic belt through northern Italy and central Switzerland during fourth-year studies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The School’s teaching philosophy is to provide a thorough understanding of Earth Sciences through experiential learning via field and lab-based study, first-hand experience in collecting data, testing hypotheses, undertaking analyses, and student-led investigative research.</p>
<p>The MGeol in Earth Sciences is taught through a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>practical classes</li>
<li>fieldwork</li>
<li>research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each sub-honours module consists of four to five lectures (80 to 110 students) and one laboratory session per week, several single-day field excursions during each semester, and tutorial sessions (typically between four and six students).</p>
<p>At Honours level, students attend lectures (20 to 30 students) and continue to develop core skills in Earth Sciences through optional modules and their own research project.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and workshops, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading relevant literature</li>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by a research-led teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Earth Sciences. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>Find contact information for all Earth Sciences staff on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/earth-sciences/people">School of Earth and Environmental Sciences website</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations, including short questions and essays.</p>
<p>At Honours level some modules are assessed through coursework (50%) and a final examination (50%), while other modules are based entirely on coursework.</p>
<p>The final-year dissertation is assessed through a written dissertation, project proposal and presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale web page</a>.</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students in the School may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6397/">Geology Society</a>, which organises activities such as lectures and networking events as well as social events and field trips across Britain.</p>
<p>The School of Earth and Environmental Sciences is housed within the Irvine Building, an attractive building close to the sea in the historical heart of the University between St Salvator's Quadrangle and St Salvator's Hall. Students will attend tutorials, seminars, lectures and individual meetings with tutors in this building and in designated lecture theatres elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
