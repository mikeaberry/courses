              <p>The BSc in Cell Biology is a four-year course run by the School of Biology. Students are provided with high-tech equipment, laboratories and expertise to facilitate learning and to develop the skillset of a modern cell biologist.</p>
<p>In the first two years of your degree you will be introduced to core material relevant to all Biology degree programmes such as animal and plant biology, molecular biology, cell biology and genetics.&nbsp;Alongside Cell Biology in the first year of your studies, you will be required to study an additional two subjects. In the second year you will usually carry on at least one of these subjects, sometimes two. Find out more about&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">how academic years are organised</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, there is a shift from core, broad-themed modules to more specialised modules that allow students to prepare for their Honours degree. In fourth year students continue specific research in their chosen area through student-led, inquiry-based learning as well as a final research project.</p>
<p>The University of St&nbsp;Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits. More information on the structure of the modules system can be found on&nbsp;the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/">flexible degree structure webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>Well-qualified school leavers may be able to apply for admission directly into the second year of this course. Find out more about <a href="direct/index.html">direct entry to second year</a>&nbsp;for Cell Biology.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Centres of research within the School of Biology offer students the experience of working alongside experts and the opportunity to develop their own research in Honours years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These facilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/">The Scottish Oceans Institute</a>&nbsp;houses a modern aquarium and laboratories for molecular, developmental and physiological studies of marine systems. The institute is ideally placed on the seashore near grey and common seal colonies and bottlenose dolphin feeding areas.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/accommodation/halls/fees">The Centre for Biological Diversity</a>&nbsp;has excellent facilities for behavioural, ecological and evolutionary research on small animals (including birds, insects and fish) and on plants.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/biology/cell-biology-bsc/direct/">The Biomedical Sciences Research Complex</a>&nbsp;offers large multi-group laboratories which focused on structural biology, molecular microbiology, virology, chemical biology, cell biology and molecular medicine.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Biology 1</strong>: provides an introduction to molecular and cellular biology. It covers cell diversity and the origins of life, cellular structures and fundamental processes.</li>
<li><strong>Biology 2</strong>: provides an introduction to the diversity of life on Earth and addresses key elements of organismal and ecological aspects of life.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>In second year, modules are chosen which will best prepare you for your intended degree (or group of possible degrees) and new topics are introduced in some second-year modules such as evolutionary biology and ecology. Students intending to study Cell Biology at Honours level must take the following modules:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell Biology</strong>: introduces the concept of ‘a cell’, moving on to discuss different types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell.</li>
<li><strong>Cell Systems</strong>:&nbsp;explores how cells interact with one another to form complex tissues and organisms.</li>
<li><strong>Research Methods in Biology</strong>:&nbsp;develops essential academic and transferable skills, with major emphasis on problem solving. This is achieved through a combination of interactive lectures, independent data-handling workshops and group work on a mini research project..</li>
</ul>
<p>and one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applied Molecular Biology</strong>:&nbsp;examines case studies to provide examples of how molecular biology techniques are applied in research to address real-life questions and problems.</li>
<li><strong>Biochemistry</strong>:&nbsp;a number of central metabolic pathways and their control are studied in detail, alongside examples of their importance in disease and recent metabolomic studies.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Molecular Biology</strong>: provides an introduction to modern molecular biology, covering fundamental biological processes such as transcription, translation, DNA replication and repair.&nbsp;</li>

<p>In this year, students also undertake a substantial final-year research project. This research project is designed to develop skills in experimental design and problem-solving, the evaluation and interpretation of data, and communication skills. The project occupies half of the year and is supervised by a member of academic staff.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The compulsory modules listed here must be taken in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours-level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules available for the current academic year can be found in <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">the module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>The BSc in Cell Biology is taught through a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>lectures</li>
<li>seminars</li>
<li>tutorials</li>
<li>practical classes</li>
<li>field work</li>
<li>research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical class sizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: lectures 240 to 270, practicals 80 to 90</li>
<li>Second year: lectures 80 to 120, practicals 40 to 60</li>
<li>Third year: lectures 20 to 60, practicals 20 to 60</li>
<li>Fourth year: seminars 5 to 20</li>
</ul>
<p>The practical elements of the course taught in the laboratory and in the field enable you to learn the wide range of skills required of a modern biologist.&nbsp;Students are provided with teaching microscopes and are taught in state-of-the-art teaching laboratories. Alongside the development of practical biological skills, students are also given the opportunity to expand on their presentation and IT skills.</p>
<p>Fourth-year teaching differs from the typical lecture, seminar and tutorial format which students will experience from years one to three. Fourth year allows you to focus on a major project which occupies half of the year. Working on this project will enable you to develop key research skills which are desired by both prospective employers and by graduate schools offering postgraduate degrees. The project can also lead to your first publication in a scientific journal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and other timetabled sessions, you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in a laboratory</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of Cell Biology. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of laboratory classes and seminars under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/flexible/">Biology staff</a>&nbsp;on the School of Biology’s website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Biology, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/biology/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage.</a>&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>During first and second year, all modules are assessed by an equal weighting of coursework and written examinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In third year, most modules give a higher weighting to examinations, and in fourth year some modules are entirely assessed by coursework, while others still include written examinations in addition to coursework.</p>
<p>Most examinations are held at the end of the semester during a dedicated exam diet and revision time is provided beforehand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on assessments and coursework within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/departmental/jfallen/?v=ug">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of Cell Biology may be interested in joining the popular student-run <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6131/">Biology Society</a>, which organises regular social meetups and biology-related events throughout the year.</p>
<p>Cell Biology students have lectures and practicals in purpose-built facilities on the North Haugh. Also at the North Haugh, students can study and access library resources at the <a href="https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings">JF Allen Science Library.</a>&nbsp;The <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/a-decade-at-the-top-for-scotlands-first-university/">Bell Pettigrew Museum</a>&nbsp;in the Bute building houses a spectacular zoology collection which includes the arrangement of species to show evolutionary relationships between animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
