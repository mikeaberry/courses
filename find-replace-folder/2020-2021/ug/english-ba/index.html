<p>You will apply to the university where you intend to spend your first year, and then you will transfer to the other institution for your second year.</p>
<h3>What you will study</h3>
<p>If you study&nbsp;the BA (International Honours) in English, you will learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>read, discuss, and reflect with clarity on a wide variety of texts and to develop analytical, descriptive and evaluative skills</li>
<li>communicate more fluently and persuasively</li>
<li>write creatively and engage critically with a wide range of English-language texts, including plays, novels, poems and short stories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BA (International Honours)&nbsp;is a single Honours degree, and other combinations – such as joint Honours degrees – are not available with this programme. However, during the programme you will have opportunities to study a range of other subjects alongside your major at both institutions.

              <p>The BA (International Honours) is a four-year undergraduate degree that combines the best of the Scottish and American educational experience.</p>
<p>Teaching in the School of English at St&nbsp;Andrews covers writing in poetry, prose, and drama from Old English up to the present day, as well as creative&nbsp;writing.</p>
<p>While the St&nbsp;Andrews degree shares many interests with William &amp; Mary, such as Romantic and Victorian literature, Shakespeare and Jane Austen, the emphases of the two departments differ. William &amp; Mary has particular strengths in American literature and offers specialist strands, for example, on African American literature. St&nbsp;Andrews, meanwhile, has expertise in Scottish and Irish writing and offers research-led teaching on a broad range of classic and innovative topics. In general, the American side of the degree has more general components while the British side offers more in-depth study in the latter two years of the programme.</p>
<p>At both universities, the International Honours degree in English aims to offer students a comprehensive introduction to literary study, to teach effective writing, and to develop skills in critical analysis. At St&nbsp;Andrews, these aims are supplemented by a range of other activities and events, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a rich programme of academic symposia and visiting speakers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ontherocksfestival.com/">On the Rocks</a>&nbsp;student drama festival</li>
<li>dramatic and musical events at the <a href="https://byretheatre.com/">Byre theatre</a></li>

<p>All English majors in the joint programme have the opportunity to work on an independent research project as part of their degree. You will either write a dissertation at St&nbsp;Andrews or take a senior research seminar at William &amp; Mary.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The compulsory modules listed here must be taken in order to graduate in this subject. However, most students at St Andrews take additional modules, either in their primary subject or from other subjects they are interested in. For Honours-level, students choose from a range of Honours modules, some of which are listed above. A full list of all modules available for the current academic year can be found in <a href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">the module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

<p>At St&nbsp;Andrews, modules are delivered through lectures which are supported by smaller seminar groups or tutorials.</p>
<p>Typical English class sizes at St&nbsp;Andrews are:</p>
<ul>
<li>First year: lectures – 240, tutorials – 5 to 9</li>
<li>Second year: lectures – 150, tutorials – 5 to 9</li>
<li>Honours: classes generally have no more than 20.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though a good deal of the study of English involves individual effort, group work provides a sense of confirmation, fruitful disagreement, and community to complement the sometimes solitary business of reading and writing.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, students at St&nbsp;Andrews are expected to undertake substantial independent, but guided, work outside of the classroom.&nbsp;Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>At St&nbsp;Andrews, you will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of English. Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of classes and seminars under the supervision of the module coordinator.</p>
<p>You can find contact information for all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/english/people/">English staff</a> on the School of English website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a>&nbsp;through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s Student Services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Modules in English at St&nbsp;Andrews are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and written exams. In each compulsory sub-honours module, there are two essays and two examination questions, each worth 25%. Assessment at Honours level varies, although essays and examinations remain a central component.</p>
<p>Coursework takes the form of essays, along with other kinds of assessed work including oral presentations, electronic projects and creative writing portfolios.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>Several Honours-level modules involve creative coursework, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>literary journal keeping</li>
<li>writing a short play</li>
<li>medieval forgery.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St&nbsp;Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a>&nbsp;and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please visit the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the outset, the University of St&nbsp;Andrews offers an array of events and opportunities which result in a truly unique student experience. Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</p>
<p>Students of English may be interested in joining the following student society:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/inklight/">Inklight</a>&nbsp;is a creative writing society which runs poetry slams, open mic nights, workshops and an annual journal of student writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of English is situated in Castle House, a beautiful Victorian building situated directly in front of the St&nbsp;Andrews Castle ruins on the coast. English students will usually attend lectures, seminars and tutorials here.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings and areas of greenery and seaside which provide a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning. If you want a change of scenery, St&nbsp;Andrews' position near surrounding towns and cities such as Anstruther, Dundee and Edinburgh makes it ideal for getting to know more about Scotland.</span></p>
