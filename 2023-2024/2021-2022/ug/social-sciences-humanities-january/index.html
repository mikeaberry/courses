                <p>The January International Foundation Programme for Social Sciences and Humanities prepares&nbsp;students&nbsp;for the demands of an undergraduate degree programme. The combination and integration of academic study skills and academic lecture courses is designed to give you a broad base of academic subject knowledge from various disciplines as well as the intellectual skills to critically analyse concepts to a high level. In particular, the programme prepares students for undergraduate study in the Faculty of Arts in St Andrews or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/william-mary-joint/">BA International Honours</a> with the College of William &amp; Mary.</p>
<p>Students will learn how to prepare extended academic essays and presentations directly related to their academic subjects, as well as complete academic and language skills examinations. During&nbsp;the programme, you will use and develop reading, writing and research skills in addition to learning from lectures.&nbsp;You will broaden&nbsp;your academic subject knowledge and develop critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will benefit from experienced and expert tuition in a friendly and supportive learning environment where you will study in small groups to accelerate your learning and adaptation to the new culture. You will have access to a personal tutor who will help you work on your time-management techniques and will support you to become an independent and reflective learner.</p>
<p>In particular, this programme provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>the potential for progression onto a single or joint Honours degree programme</li>
<li>a thorough grounding in classical and sociological issues pertaining to a range of disciplines in the arts and humanities</li>
<li>small group teaching with highly experienced teachers</li>
<li>intensive and academic teaching designed to help you develop the skills to succeed</li>
<li>a strong emphasis on criticality, improving analytical skills, time management and writing in authentic academic contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the programme you will have a clear understanding of the key ideas that underpin many of the subjects that you will be going on to study. You will also have knowledge of the university system and experience of different types of assessment.</p>
