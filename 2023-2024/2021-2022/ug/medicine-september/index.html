<h4><strong>Academic requirements</strong></h4>
<p>Typical&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/assets/university/subjects/documents/international-foundation/medicine-ifp-academic-requirements-2021-2022.pdf" class="ga-event__download">Medicine IFP and International Pathway to Medicine academic requirements</a> <acronym>(PDF)</acronym>  &nbsp;are listed alphabetically by country. If your qualification is not shown here, please email <a href="mailto:ifp@st-andrews.ac.uk&nbsp;">ifp@st-andrews.ac.uk</a>&nbsp;about the grades needed from your high school system.</p>
<p>You can demonstrate that you have met&nbsp;the academic requirements with a high school transcript from your final year at school. Any high school qualification you use as evidence of your academic ability should be from the last year you attended high school and dated within the previous three years.</p>
<p>You should apply before your final results are available, as the University&nbsp;can make you a conditional offer based on your past exam performance and predicted grades.</p>
<h4><strong>English language requirement</strong></h4>
<p>All foundation applicants must submit a Secure English Test (SELT) as evidence of their English language ability, unless they have a UK passport.</p>
<p>See a list of <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/language-requirements/pre-degree/">approved English language tests and required scores</a> for International Foundation programmes.</p>
<p>You do not need to have your result when you apply, as this can be a condition of an offer made by the University.</p>
<p><strong>Work experience requirement</strong></p>
<p>Students are required to have experience that allows them to demonstrate interpersonal skills relevant to the practice of medicine. This may include voluntary or work experience, and clinical observations. Applicants are advised to keep a record (for example, a diary) of this, as students will reflect upon these experiences throughout their foundation programme.</p>
<h3><strong>Application requirements</strong></h3>
<p>The University requires you to provide the following documents as part of your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>your most recent high school transcript</li>
<li>a&nbsp;personal statement outlining why you wish to study medicine at St Andrews and reflecting on your life and learning experiences to explain why you feel you would be successful on this programme</li>
<li>an academic reference from your high school on their letterhead or from a school email</li>
<li>your official English language test result.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application deadline</h3>
<p>The deadline for applications is Sunday 1 August 2021.&nbsp;<strong>You&nbsp;only need to&nbsp;provide your high school transcript and personal statement when you first apply</strong>&nbsp;so that the University can consider your application. Your academic reference and your English language evidence can be provided later.</p>

		<p>- If you're thinking of applying to St Andrews, you definitely should.</p>
<p>It's so rewarding. There are so many things you can do here.</p>
<p>Although it's a small town, the opportunities are completely endless.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;FIONA: St Andrew's location is stunning. A small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR JUDITH WOLFE: Close enough to places like Edinburgh, and frankly to all of Europe. We are connected while also being our own place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;HENRY: For me, the best thing about St Andrews is the fact that it's such a small town, but yet it's got so many different opportunities within it.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;THOMAS: Whether it's the societies or the sports clubs that you can get involved with. It's so much more than just academia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR JAMES RAE: St Andrews is a fantastic place to study because you get a university that has a strong research focus, but it's also a university that really values its teaching. We do that through having small class sizes, and through, I think, a really, a kind of strong community feel.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;AABIYAH: The lecturers are really, really helpful. There's not this kind of hierarchy or anything. Everyone's really, really friendly and everyone's really trying to help out.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR KISHAN DHOLAKIA: Why does a person go to University? They want to expand their mind. They want to push the boundaries of what they know from a personal level and an academic level. It's not just education, it's research. Because they want to go to a place that is pushing the frontiers of human knowledge.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR DHARINI BALASUBRAMANIAM: We look for people who are willing to question what they are taught and willing to explore their subject in depth.</p>
<p>- We want people who are curious, who are motivated, who want to understand the world around them, and then apply that to make ideally the world a better place.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR CLARE PEDDIE: The University degree at St Andrews reflects the Scottish degree system. Students coming into first and second year can take subjects outside their intended degree specialisation and then specialise in their degree subjects in third, and fourth, and possibly fifth year.</p>
<p>- It just offers an opportunity to explore new subjects and it's kind of changed my way of thinking.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;MARKUS: It really helped me to just explore different things and try out everything.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has a really big feel.</p>
<p>-You really get to know everyone. You see a lot of people that you know and you recognise.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;RACHEL: Hall life plays such a big part in St Andrews. Living in halls has such a wonderful atmosphere.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SHUTONG: It is a really tight community.</p>
<p>- You get a lot of different students, you get to meet a lot of different people which you normally wouldn't meet.</p>
<p>- We come from very different educational backgrounds, so, therefore, we're all gonna have a different point of view. So, you know, you're not gonna have people that agree with you all the time or they're gonna pick up on things that you don't necessarily pick up on.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;DR STEPHEN TYRE: With a St Andrews degree you can almost do anything because the skills that you learn here are attractive to employers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER: Our students go into all kinds of professional careers, whether that's the law, whether that's financial services, whether that's civil service or government. Many of them also go into further study.</p>
<p>- Our students tend to be in great demand from employers. We have companies that see character in graduates.</p>
<p>- The skills that students get here allow our students to be successful at getting jobs, and they seem to be equipped very well for a wide range of jobs.</p>
<p>- If you're thinking of applying, do it. Absolutely do it. It's been one of the best decisions that I've made.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;SARA: St Andrews really isn't a place to be afraid of, but going to college is scary, because you don't know what you're gonna have when you get there, but it's really great here because it's so easy to feel like you have everything.</p>

                <p>The International Foundation programme for Medicine has been designed with the University's School of Medicine to develop your sciences and communication skills to prepare you for success in a degree in medicine.</p>
<p>Central to the Medicine Foundation programme is an ethos of cooperation and collaboration amongst students, which is achieved through group work and projects in the context of a supportive environment for personal and academic growth. </p>
<p>You will be given personal tutorial slots each semester where you can discuss all aspects of academic work and life. Through these tutorials, you will learn how to adopt and develop positive mindsets and learning strategies in order to help you during the programme and your future degree.</p>
<p>English language teachers will work with you to develop your academic writing, your study techniques and your time-management skills.</p>
<p>Foundation programme classes integrate your science and English language learning through their focus on writing laboratory reports, structuring essays, critical thinking and scientific methods of investigation. In addition, you will practice doctor-patient interaction, including with simulated patients, and have opportunities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>consolidate your learning and attend a workshop to prepare for the multiple mini interviews (MMI)</li>
<li>volunteer with a local charity which provides support and companionship for the elderly and vulnerable in the local area</li>
<li>gain an accredited first-aid certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme enables international students to function effectively as undergraduates studying medicine, enhancing their discipline-specific knowledge and skills, and developing critical thinking and reflection.</p>
<p>By the end of the programme students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>demonstrate an overall appreciation of the body of philosophies related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate knowledge that is embedded in the main theories, concepts and principles of the philosophies related to the study of medicine and apply that knowledge in practical contexts</li>
<li>undertake critical analysis, evaluation and synthesis of ideas, concepts, information and issues that are within the common understandings of health and medicine</li>
<li>demonstrate awareness of own and others’ roles, responsibilities and contributions when carrying out and evaluating tasks related to the study of medicine</li>
<li>convey complex information to a range of audiences such as fellow students, medical professionals, and patients</li>
<li>exercise autonomy and initiative in some activities in their learning</li>
<li>manage, under guidance, ethical and professional issues in accordance with current professional codes related to the medical profession.</li>

                <h2>Requirements for moving onto BSc Medicine (A100)</h2>
<p>To progress onto the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/medicine/medicine-bsc-a100/">BSc Medicine (A100)</a> at St Andrews, students must pass all modules on the programme and achieve:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>an&nbsp;average grade of 11.0 or above at first sitting across the following modules:
<ul>
<li>Foundations for Medicine&nbsp;1 (IE1101)</li>
<li>Foundations for Medicine 2 (IE1201)</li>
<li>Human Biology (IE1252)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an grade of 12.0 or above&nbsp;at first sitting in each of the following modules:<br>
<ul>
<li>Biology 1 (BL 1101)</li>
<li>Introductory Inorganic and Physical Chemistry (CH1401)</li>
<li>Organic and Biological Chemistry 1 (CH1601)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results are graded on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/academicdatateam/assessmentandawards/gradingsheets/">University's 20-point scale</a>.</p>
<p>Students must also meet the following entry requirements of the School of Medicine:</p>
<ul>
<li>a competitive score in UCAT, achieved in the year of entry onto the International Foundation programme for Medicine. If this condition is not met, the competitive score on UCAT can also be achieved in the year of graduation from the International Foundation programme, prior to entry onto A100 BSc Medicine.</li>
<li>satisfactory performance on the&nbsp;multiple mini interviews with the School of Medicine</li>
<li>applicants who use English as an additional language and who cannot provide their English language ability through their school-leaving qualifications must achieve 7.0 in all four components of the&nbsp;<wbr>International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) exam, to be taken at one sitting. This is irrespective of any other English qualification achieved. The final four consecutive years of secondary or&nbsp;<wbr>high school education in an English-medium school may in some cases be considered as evidence of English language ability. This will be considered on a case by case basis. IELTS scores have a&nbsp;<wbr>recommended two-year validity period, and this time limit will be applied.</li>
<li>fulfilment of the 'fitness to practise' criteria listed on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/medicine/medicine-bsc-a100/entry-requirements/">School of Medicine entry requirements web page</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional information</h4>
<p>Provided that&nbsp;you meet the above entry requirements for the School of Medicine at the University of St&nbsp;Andrews, you will be given an unconditional offer to enter&nbsp;first&nbsp;year of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/medicine/medicine-bsc-a100/">BSc Medicine&nbsp;(A100)</a>.</p>
<p>The programme director for Medicine (International Foundation) is required to comment on your fitness to practise Medicine at the end of&nbsp;your studies when you are considered for the BSc Medicine degree. Under the School of Medicine’s policy, any concerns about your health or previous conduct or both may be considered at the time of application or prior to entry to the medical course. For more information, please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/medicine/medicine-bsc-a100/entry-requirements/">entry requirements for BSc Medicine</a>.</p>
<h4>Studying a Science degree instead of BSc Medicine (A100)</h4>
<p>Students who do not move on to medicine but meet the academic requirements for the Faculty of Science, may be able to study a science degree at the University. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account both student performance, and capacity within the relevant subject area. Students can also apply to secure a place at another institution. Programme&nbsp;directors will assist with advice and UCAS applications as necessary to work towards the best possible outcome for you.</p>
