  <p><span lang="EN">The MMath (Hons) in Applied Mathematics will teach you to understand complex patterns and structures, and develop the tools with which to analyse them. Whether these patterns relate to physical or biological phenomena or the structure of mathematics itself, the primary aim is to describe, categorise, and understand the processes involved.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Students of Applied Mathematics will specifically focus on real-world applications of mathematics, applying their tools to solve problems in fields as diverse as biology, astrophysics, and finance.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">The MMath allows you to combine undergraduate and postgraduate study into a single five-year programme, graduating with a Masters degree.&nbsp;</span>Students can also take Mathematics as a standard four-year <a href="../mathematics-bsc/index.html">BSc</a> or <a href="../mathematics-ma/index.html">MA</a> degree.</p>
<h3>Accreditation</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;MMath in Applied Mathematics is accredited by the&nbsp;<a href="https://ima.org.uk/">Institute of Mathematics and its Applications</a>.</p>

                <p>Mathematics and Statistics at St Andrews is very popular, and the&nbsp;University is unable to make an offer to every applicant who meets or exceeds the entry requirements. The University seeks to recruit students who are enthusiastic about mathematics and possess the demonstrated potential to be successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entry requirements are the same for&nbsp;all single&nbsp;Honours degrees in mathematics and statistics, and the chance of receiving an offer does not depend on the degree or entry point applied for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decisions are primarily based on mathematical ability and potential, as demonstrated by school qualifications and position in class or year. The School of Mathematics and Statistics does not use results from MAT or STEP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applicants should, therefore, include as much detail about their mathematics results as possible on their&nbsp;application <strong>if available</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Highers: band attained as well as the grade, and ideally the percentage attained for Higher Mathematics.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A-Levels: grades obtained in each of the mathematics modules taken to date, if any.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For guidance on other entry qualifications, please see <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/">entry requirements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If possible, applicants should include their rank within their year and any awards they have won at school.&nbsp;Applicants should ask their referees to also include this information in their reference.</p>
<p>Applicants should also include any extra-curricular mathematical and scientific accomplishments. This can include, for example, competition results (e.g. Maths Challenge and Olympiads) or previous university-level experience (e.g. from&nbsp;summer programmes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The MMath (Hons) in Applied Mathematics is a five-year Integrated Masters course run by the School of Mathematics and Statistics. The course offers advanced study of Mathematics at postgraduate level during your final year, allowing you to graduate with a Masters degree.</p>
<p>In the first two years, you will develop and reinforce your basic mathematical skills and refresh familiar material (e.g. complex numbers, matrices, vectors, differential equations) in preparation for more specialist study at Honours level.</p>
<p>Alongside Applied Mathematics, in the first year of your studies you will be required to study&nbsp;up to&nbsp;two additional subjects. In the second year, students only take Mathematics modules. Find out more about <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/study-options/ug/degree-routes/honours/">how academic years are organised</a>.</p>
<p>At Honours and Masters level, students may select modules from a range of options on advanced and specialist specific topics, especially focused on Applied Mathematics. Specialist subject areas may include (among others):</p>
<ul>
<li>fluid dynamics</li>
<li>computing in mathematics</li>
<li>mathematical biology</li>
<li>solar theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final-year students must also undertake an advanced project on a topic chosen in consultation with teaching staff at the School of Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Teaching format</h3>
<p>In first year, teaching for each module centres on a daily lecture (100 to&nbsp;300 students) and a weekly small group tutorial (8 to 12 students) where students undertake exercises and discuss each week’s topics. In addition, computer labs (25 to 60 students) are held once a week for each module to assist with both computing and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>In second year, each module typically comprises five lectures (100 to&nbsp;300 students), one tutorial (8 to 12 students), one computer lab (25 to 60 students), and one examples class (25 to 60 students) per fortnight.&nbsp;Half of the modules also feature computer lab sessions (25 to 60 students).</p>
<p>You will develop increasing independence and initiative as you progress through your degree programme so that by third, fourth and fifth year the average teaching load drops to around ten hours of lectures and four tutorials per week, supplemented by private study.</p>
<p>When not attending lectures, tutorials and computer labs you will be expected to continue learning independently through self-study. Typically, this will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>working on individual and group projects</li>
<li>undertaking research in the library</li>
<li>preparing coursework assignments and presentations</li>
<li>preparing for examinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be taught by an experienced teaching team with expertise and knowledge of mathematics.&nbsp;Postgraduate research students who have undertaken teacher training may also contribute to the teaching of tutorials, examples classes and computing classes under the supervision of the module leader.</p>
<p>Find contact information for all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/mathematics-statistics/people/">Mathematics staff</a> on the School of Mathematics and Statistics website.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, optional <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/academic/">academic support is available</a> through practical study skills courses and workshops hosted within the University.</p>
<p>The University’s student services team can help students with additional needs resulting from disabilities, long term medical conditions or learning disabilities. More information can be found on the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/support/students-with-disabilities/">students with disabilities web page</a>.</p>

                <h3 data-unsp-sanitized="clean">Assessment</h3>
<p>Progress is monitored through tutorial assignments, and sub-honours modules are assessed by a balanced combination of coursework and written exams. At Honours level, modules may be assessed by written examination alone or a combination of written examination and coursework.</p>
<p>Examinations are held at the end of each semester during a dedicated exam diet with revision time provided beforehand.</p>
<p>The School aims to provide feedback on every assessment within three weeks to help you improve on future assessments.</p>
<p>Undergraduates at the University of St Andrews must achieve at least 7.0 on the St Andrews 20-point grade scale to pass a module. To gain access to Honours-level modules, students must achieve the relevant requisites as specified in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/media/teaching-and-learning/policies/honsentry.pdf">policy on entry to Honours</a> and in the relevant <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/reqs/">programme requirements</a>. Please note that some Schools offer qualified entry to Honours, and this will be clearly specified in the programme requirements. To find out the classification equivalent of points, please&nbsp;see the <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/teaching/examinations/scale/">common reporting scale</a>.</p>

Students participate in a range of traditions, notably, the red academic gown and the academic family, where older students adopt first year students as ‘children’ and help guide them in a system of mentoring. These traditions and the choice of over 150 sports clubs and student societies to choose from ensures a community feel amongst students from first year onwards.</span></p>
<p>Students of Mathematics may be interested in joining the <a href="https://www.yourunion.net/activities/society/6600/">Mathematics Society (SUMS)</a>, a society dedicated to bringing people together who are interested in maths. They hold regular socials and informative talks from guest speakers.</p>
<p><span lang="EN">The School of Mathematics and Statistics is currently&nbsp;located across&nbsp;two sites – the Mathematical Institute on the North Haugh and the Scott Lang Building at the Observatory. Most of the Mathematics staff and research students can be found at the Mathematical Institute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The town of St&nbsp;Andrews itself has lots to offer. As University buildings are located throughout the town, walking around you encounter ancient and modern buildings, parks and beaches, providing a rich, beautiful backdrop to learning.
