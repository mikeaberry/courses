<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p>The MSc in Geochemistry is a full-time taught postgraduate programme run by the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>Geochemistry is a fundamental discipline within the Earth Sciences, providing the techniques and knowledge to address such fundamental questions as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the rates and drivers of climate change, both past and present?</li>
<li>How do we assess and remediate environmental degradation?</li>
<li>Was there ever life on Mars?</li>
<li>How do planets form?</li>
</ul>
<p>The course is comprehensive and rigorous, comprising compulsory and optional taught modules, field work, short courses, and a research dissertation. Hands-on experience developing a diverse set of laboratory skills is embedded into the course.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The MSc provides preparation for pursuing a PhD through a lab-based research dissertation, or employment in industry by incorporating applied economic and environmental geochemistry modules and the possibility of industry-sponsored research.</li>
<li>Teaching and supervision spans a&nbsp;wide range of expertise in the field of geochemistry, underpinned by state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.</li>
<li>The course introduces academic and industry-standard software for robust geochemical modelling and statistical analysis of data.</li>
<li>The School upholds a collegiate,&nbsp;dynamic and research-intensive atmosphere that&nbsp;encourages, and is supportive of, all students.</li>

</ul>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University's position on <a href="#53225">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The third semester of the MSc course focuses on independent laboratory-based (or field and laboratory-based) research conducted with an academic supervisor. The topic is defined by the student and can be chosen from research foci within the School, or with an external industrial or academic partner.</p>
<p>The research project will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>background literature review</li>
<li>project formulation</li>
<li>proposal writing and analytical design</li>
<li>data integration and interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students present the results of their project as an oral presentation at a poster conference and in a dissertation. The completed dissertation of not more than 15,000 words must be submitted by a date towards the end of August.</p>
<p>If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MSc, there&nbsp;is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2021 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>

                <h3>Careers</h3>
<p>The range of research areas and applications of Geochemistry is so broad that career opportunities span the whole of earth and environmental sciences. Masters-level training in Geochemistry would provide a suitable platform for a career in materials science outside of earth and environmental sciences specifically.</p>
<p>Geochemists with MSc degrees are employed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>the energy sector (hydrocarbon industries, petrochemicals, nuclear and renewables)</li>
<li>mining and mineral exploration, extraction and processing</li>
<li>environmental industries and agencies focused on pollution monitoring and environmental remediation</li>
<li>universities as laboratory technicians running equipment and supporting high-quality data production for research projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/careers/">Careers Centre</a> offers one-to-one advice to all students on a taught postgraduate course and offers a programme of events to assist students&nbsp;in building their employability skills.</p>

<h4>Curriculum development</h4>
<p>As a research intensive institution, the University ensures that its teaching references the research interests of its staff, which may change from time to time. As a result, programmes are regularly reviewed with the aim of enhancing students' learning experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/academic-policies-curriculum-curriculum-at-st-andrews/curriculum-at-st-andrews.pdf">Our approach to course revision is described online</a>.</p>
<h4>Tuition fees</h4>
<p>The University will clarify compulsory fees and charges it requires any student to pay at the time of offer. The offer will also clarify conditions for any variation of fees.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/policy/student-administration-tuition-fees/fee-setting.pdf">The University’s approach to fee setting is described online</a>.</p>
