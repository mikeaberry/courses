<p>- One of the things that is really important is that we are a community of scholars. The staff, and the students.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; HANNAH (MLitt Museum and Gallery Studies, Nottingham, England): Life at St Andrews is wonderful. I think it's completely unique. There's so much to do. You cannot be bored.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; MORAG (PhD Modern History, Forfar, Scotland): I have so many ideas about what I'm going to do when I graduate. I've had loads of opportunities, and I've met so many new people.</p>
<p>- St Andrews has an excellent track record of seeing their postgraduates move onto illustrious careers in all walks of life.</p>
<p>- Students make a lot of contacts during their studies, and that can lead to career opportunities once they graduate.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR FRANK LORENZ MULLER (Dean of Arts and Divinity): We have everything from lawyers, to diplomats, to journalists. They come with this great mark of quality onto a market that wants to take them into either professional or academic life afterwards.</p>
<p>- When I was studying biology, I read a book written by one of the professors here. Getting to have classes and meet him was, like, amazing for me!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; KARA (MLitt Terrorism and Political Violence, Edinburgh, Scotland): It was really a no-brainer when I went to look for my Masters degree. I really wanted the international community that St Andrews offers as well as they've got an international reputation.</p>
<p>- Before studying at St Andrews I have always lived in a big city. Moving to St Andrews was definitely a change of scenery. It didn't take me too long to get used to it, and it was lovely. It just makes me feel like I'm home.</p>
<p>- I have loved every second of being in St Andrews, and I recommend it to everyone I meet now. It is welcoming and diverse, and you get so many different people, and new ideas, and experiences that you would never have anywhere else.</p>

                <p>Healthcare is being transformed by digital technologies and big data analytics. On the MSc in Digital Health you will explore the principles and practice of digital health implementation.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aimed at students intending to follow a career in digital health.</li>
<li>Interdisciplinary character helps you to develop a more rounded understanding of digital health questions and concepts.</li>
<li>Applied components provide practical skills in medical data analysis and the use of digital technologies to address healthcare challenges.</li>

</ul>
<p>The MSc in Digital Health is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and an emphasis on applied skills that will be of particular value if you are looking to follow a career in digital health.</p>
<p>Digital technology is transforming healthcare. It is enabling faster diagnosis and better treatment of illnesses, supporting improvements in patient care, and making healthcare settings more efficient. That transformation is creating a need for professionals who understand existing medical technologies and who have the skills and expertise to develop new technologies, analyse medical data, and inform policy on medical data analytics. Students from the MSc in Digital Health will be able to fill those roles.</p>
<p>On the MSc you will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of digital health. You will look at different forms of health data, the technology that generate them, methods used for processing and analysis, and how digital data is integrated in clinical decision making. In particular, you will develop an appreciation of the challenges in handling, storing and analysing big data in healthcare contexts. An understanding of these principles provides a basis for studying the practical applications of digital health and developing your understanding of how digital health concepts can be applied to solve real-world medical problems. You will learn practical skills in medical data analysis and the use of digital technologies to address healthcare challenges. You will develop your understanding of techniques for programmatically processing medical data such as genetic data, medical images, and patient vital signs. You will also learn about digital health governance and the ethical considerations that can arise when designing and executing medical data analysis studies.</p>
<p>Particular attention is paid to training in bioinformatics and the modelling and analysis of medical data such as patient records and medical images. Theoretical learning is applied to real-world case studies, and you will develop an understanding of practitioner and industry perspectives and the work that is needed across academia and other sectors to advance digital health. More broadly, you will develop practical skills in explaining digital health concepts to different audiences and the translation of academic thinking on digital into recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.</p>
<p>Digital health is inherently interdisciplinary. This MSc brings together academic staff, National Health Service (NHS) colleagues, and industrial partners providing a greater breadth of learning that encompasses real clinical problems as well as the solutions that digital health can provide.</p>
<p>In this way you will engage with critical perspectives on digital health principles and practice. You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of digital health questions and concepts. Through research-led teaching from scholars working in subjects including computer science, medicine, and statistics you will gain an appreciation of the technical, clinical, and analytical aspects of digital health and learn how to critically discuss digital health solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.</p>
<p>Optional modules allow you to explore topics such as biomedical imaging, information visualisation, and datamining that will broaden your learning in key areas and further develop the interdisciplinary character of your studies.</p>
<p>The MSc includes an integrated programme of skills workshops that connect your academic learning with the development of personal and professional competencies. Workshops bring together students from other Graduate School for Interdisciplinary Studies Masters degrees, helping you to make new interdisciplinary connections.</p>
<p>The MSc in Digital Health has close links with the <a href="http://med.st-andrews.ac.uk/mackenzie/">Sir James Mackenzie Institute for Early Diagnosis</a>. The Institute brings together researchers from a range of disciplines and builds on St Andrews’ international reputation in digital diagnosis, health data research, and biophotonics. These links will bring you into contact with current digital health research, giving your studies a remarkable richness and depth.</p>
<h3>Teaching format</h3>
<p>The taught modules are taken over two semesters – September to December (Semester 1) and January to May (Semester 2). The period from June to August is used to complete the end of degree project.</p>
<p>Each taught module will use teaching and learning methods appropriate to its aims. These may include seminars, workshops, lectures, tutorials, and independent study.</p>
<p>Assessment methods used may include essays, reports, presentations, practical exercises, reflective exercises, and examinations.</p>

<p>The MSc is structured around two compulsory taught modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Health Principles</strong>:&nbsp;explores the theoretical underpinnings of digital health; students consider different forms of health data, technologies and methods for processing and analysis, and the integration of digital data in clinical decision making.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students will normally also be required to complete the following modules unless they have significant experience in statistics and programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introductory Data Analysis:&nbsp;</strong>provides training in essential statistical concepts and data analysis methods for academic and professional contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>and&nbsp;one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong>&nbsp;provides training in object-oriented modelling, design, and implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Programming Principles and Practice:</strong>&nbsp;introduces general programming concepts such as data structures, functions, choice, iteration, recursion, and input&nbsp;and output.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Semester 2</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Health Practice:</strong>&nbsp;looks at the practical applications of digital health; students learn practical skills in medical data analysis and the use of digital technologies to address healthcare challenges.</li>
</ul></div><div id="modules-year-2" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>Optional modules allow you to broaden your learning in key topics relevant to the MSc.</p>
<p>The available optional modules&nbsp;will be confirmed&nbsp;before the MSc start date.</p>
<p>Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position on <a href="#53225">curriculum development</a>).</p></div><div id="modules-year-3" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel"><p>The final part of the MSc is the end of degree project. This takes the form of a period of supervised research where you will explore a digital health topic in depth.</p>
<p>Through the project you will show your ability to undertake sustained critical analysis, develop and improve your research skills, and produce an extended piece of written work that demonstrates a high level of understanding of your area of study.</p>
<p>You can choose to present your end of degree project as one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>policy report that emphasises your ability to critically assess digital health policy and make convincing recommendations for policy changes</li>
<li>multi-media portfolio that emphasises your ability present digital health concepts in exciting and engaging ways</li>
<li>written dissertation that emphasises your ability to plan and execute academically rigorous research.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students choose not to complete the project requirement for the MSc, there&nbsp;is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-8"><br><p>The modules listed here are indicative, and there is no guarantee they will run for 2021 entry.&nbsp;Take a look at the most up-to-date modules in the <a title="Home%20%BB%20University%20%BB%20Administration%20A-Z%20%BB%20Course%20Catalogue%20%BB%20Postgraduate | Links to: Home » University » Administration A-Z » Course Catalogue » Postgraduate" href="https://portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/catalogue/">module catalogue</a>.</p></div></div></div></section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"></div></div></div>
