<p>Highers must include Chemistry and one of Biology (or Human Biology), Mathematics or Physics, to be taken at the same sitting. If not passed at Higher, applicants must also have National 5 grade B in Biology (or Human Biology), Mathematics, and English.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find out more about Standard, Minimum and Gateway entry requirements using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/academic-entry-explained/"><strong>academic entry explained</strong></a> and see which entry requirements are appropriate to you using the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/entry/indicator"><strong>entry requirements indicator</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>For applicants to Medicine to be considered with the Minimum entry requirements, they would need to be assessed as:</p>
<ul>
<li>residing in the lowest 40% most deprived areas of the UK.&nbsp;<br /><strong>or</strong></li>
<li>being looked after as a result of a local authority order. See information on <a href="/study/apply/care-experienced/" target="null">care experienced applicants</a>.&nbsp;<br /><strong>or</strong></li>
<li>being registered as a young carer. See information on&nbsp;<a href="/study/apply/young-carers/" target="null">young carers</a>.&nbsp;<br /><strong>or</strong></li>

<li>being a refugee.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Guidance</strong></h4>
<p>Applicants should also note the following entry exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher qualifications should normally be obtained at the same sitting in S5. Exceptions may be made for candidates who attend schools which are unable to present pupils for five Highers at one sitting.</li>
<li>Lifeskills Maths and Applications of Maths will not be accepted to meet the National 5 Maths requirement.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Higher ESOL may be taken to meet the National 5 English requirement if National 5 English is not offered. National 5 ESOL will not be considered to meet this requirement. Only one of Higher ESOL or Higher English will be considered as one of the 5 Highers required in one sitting.</li>
<li>Students not taking the required sciences or mathematics in S5 may take the missing subjects in S6. Two science subjects must be sat in the same year (to include Chemistry) &ndash; either S5 or S6.</li>
<li>A mix of Highers and Advanced Highers in S5 would be considered. Advanced Highers, new Highers, or a mix of Advanced Highers and new Highers would be acceptable for S6 study.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Offers made will be conditional and based on S6 programmes of study.</li>
<li>An applicant&rsquo;s referee should include predicted grades for S6 in the application.</li>
<li>An A grade at Higher or Advanced Higher would not balance out a C grade in another subject.</li>
<li>Applicants sitting Highers earlier than S5 gain no advantage in the School's admissions assessment.</li>
<li>Applicants sitting&nbsp;six Highers in S5, as opposed to five Highers, gain no advantage in&nbsp;the School's admissions assessment.</li>
<li>Applicants sitting the Scottish Baccalaureate gain no advantage in&nbsp;the School's admissions assessment, other than for the Advanced Highers associated with it. However, the development of research skills will be useful for entrants to&nbsp;the course.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Over and above the subjects required for entry,&nbsp;the School does not have a preference for other subjects in S5 or S6; applicants should choose subjects they are interested in or will do well in.</li>
